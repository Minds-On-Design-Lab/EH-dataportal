                        <p>The Health Department designed NYCCAS to understand how average air pollution levels vary from place to place within New York City. NYCCAS staff mount samplers on street light poles 10 to 12 feet off the ground along residential and commercial streets and in parks. The monitors use a small battery-powered pump and filters to collect air samples. Our air samplers are deployed at each NYCCAS site once each season and collect data for a two-week period. Samples are collected in all seasons for NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and BC; in the summer for O<sub>3</sub>; and in the winter for SO<sub>2</sub>. For more details on sample collection methods, see <a href="https://nyccas.cityofnewyork.us/nyccas2021v9/sites/default/files/NYCCAS-appendix/Appendix1.pdf">Appendix 1 (PDF)</a>.</p>
                        <p>The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also has a network of 19 air quality monitors in New York City that are required by the Federal government, but they are mounted on building roofs. We placed our air samplers at street level to measure pollution where people spend time, and where traffic-related pollution levels are usually higher.</p>
                        <p>NYCCAS has also deployed a limited number of monitors that can measure PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in real time. These monitors allow us to monitor air pollution as it changes based on the time of day, weather or due to local pollution sources, such as heavy-duty trucks. The data from these monitors is available here: <a href="https://nychealth.github.io/EH-dataportal/key-topics/airquality/realtime/">Real-Time Air Quality</a>.</p>

                                        Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are tiny airborne solid and liquid particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter. PM<sub>2.5</sub> is the most harmful urban air pollutant. It is small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, which can worsen lung and heart disease and lead to hospital admissions and premature deaths. PM<sub>2.5</sub> can either be directly emitted or formed in the atmosphere from other pollutants. Fuel combustion in vehicles, boilers in buildings, power plants, construction equipment, marine vessels and commercial cooking are all common sources of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Up to 40% of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> in New York City's air comes from sources in areas upwind from the city, such as coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.

                                        Black carbon (BC) is one type of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and is the sooty black material emitted from gas and diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, and other sources that burn fossil fuels. It comprises up to 20% of fine particulate matter in New York City. Unlike other fine particles, BC is primarily from local sources. Inhalation of BC is associated with health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer and birth defects. BC also contributes to climate change by altering the patterns of rain and clouds.

                                        Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) are part of a group of pollutants called &amp;ldquo;oxides of nitrogen&amp;rdquo; (NOX). Exposures to NOX are linked to increased emergency department visits and hospitalizations for respiratory conditions, particularly asthma. NOX also reacts with other compounds in the atmosphere to form PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. A variety of combustion sources produce NOX in New York City, including motor vehicles, buildings, marine vessels and construction equipment.

                                        Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) forms at ground level when NOX emissions combine with sunlight and other airborne pollutants. Measured O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are often highest in the summer and downwind from areas with high NOX emissions, such as places with high traffic density. In areas with heavy traffic, NOX reacts with any ground-level O<sub>3</sub> to reduce O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. As a result, NYCCAS has measured lower O3 levels near roadways, in city centers and in other areas of high NOX emissions density. Higher levels of O<sub>3</sub> are seen in areas away from dense traffic and building emissions.

                                        Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is produced mainly by burning oils with high sulfur content, such as No. 4 and No. 6 oil (also known as residual fuel oil), or high-sulfur No. 2 oil. The primary use of fuel oil in NYC is to heat buildings and water, which is why we only monitor it in the winter. Some high-sulfur oil is also used to generate electricity and power marine vessels. SO2 exposures can worsen lung diseases, causing hospitalizations and emergency department visits for asthma and other respiratory conditions. SO<sub>2</sub> also contributes to the formation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the atmosphere, resulting in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures downwind of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

                        <p>The monitoring locations represent a wide variety of New York City environments – sidewalks, busy streets, parks and quiet neighborhood roads. Most of the sites (80%) were chosen by the Health Department at random to ensure representation in all types of neighborhoods, including residential, commercial and industrial areas. The remaining sites were selected because they are near potentially high-emission locations that were not captured in the random assignment. These include Times Square, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. The locations vary in tree canopy and in the density of traffic and buildings. The number of sites has changed over the years as we have learned about air quality in our city. In 2021, we monitored 78 routine locations and an additional 15 sites in low-income neighborhoods that would benefit from additional monitoring to understand potential sources of emissions. We refer to these as <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Closerlook/AQsnapshots/Index.html#section5">Environmental Justice Sites</a> on the map.</p>

                            <p>Citywide, annual average levels of fine particulate matter declined by 40% between 2009 and 2021, an average of 0.4 micrograms per cubic meter per year.

                            <p>Recently, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been seen at sites with nearby commercial cooking grills/charbroilers and traffic emissions. This is largely due to buildings using cleaner fuels for heating and therefore emitting less PM<sub>2.5</sub> than when NYCCAS began monitoring.

            <h3>Pollutant predictors</h3>
            <p>NYCCAS data were analyzed using a land-use regression (LUR) model. LUR models estimate associations among pollution levels, average traffic, building emissions, land use and other neighborhood factors around the monitoring sites. The pollution sources that contribute most to differences in concentrations of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, BC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> across NYC are listed in the table below. SO<sub>2</sub> is now so low in NYC that it is not possible to build a LUR model for the most recent years of data.</p><p>Fuel used to provide heat and hot water in buildings has become significantly cleaner under state and local regulations requiring use of cleaner burning fuels. As a result, commercial charbroiling and grilling operations have become a more important source of PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions over the past several years due to state and local regulations mandating cleaner burning fuels for building heat and hot water. The number of commercial cooking charbroilers and grills in an area now explains PM<sub>2.5</sub> differences among neighborhoods better than building emissions. For more information on these changes, please see <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq-cooking/">Tracking changes in New York City's sources of air pollution</a>.</p>
