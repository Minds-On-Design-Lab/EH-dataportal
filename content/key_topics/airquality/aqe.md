Your neighborhood's air quality. Insert neighborhood to continue. 

We've reorganized pages into directories with _index.md; gave each _index a layout: single to ensure displays as single page. 

Main question:
- What's the best way to handle these custom pages that have their own CSS and JS? Is it more like a custom template - where most of the stuff is built into the 'template' page? E.g., we put ```layout: aqe``` in our frontmatter, and we just write most of the page in themes/layouts/key_topics/airquality/aqe.html?
