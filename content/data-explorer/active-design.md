Physical activity and healthy eating rank among the leading ways to get and stay healthy. 

Active design is an applied, evidence-informed approach to improve physical, mental and social health outcomes through the design of the built environment. 

To improve health, we can:
* Increase access to public parks and recreation
* Create pedestrian plazas,  and maintain sidewalks
* Plant street trees
* Provide safer cycling infrastructure and secure bicycle storage
* Make stairways attractive and accessible

Strategies like these can have a measurable effect on peopleâ€™s ability to safely maintain their physical, mental, and social health.
