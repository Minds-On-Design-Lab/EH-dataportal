Measuring the quality of NYC harbor water tells us about the health of our water. Healthy waterways are important for both aquatic life and humans who want to fish and swim.

We measure the quality of harbor water through two key indicators:

- **Dissolved oxygen** is essential for most aquatic life. This includes fish, invertebrates, crabs, clams, and zooplankton. Coastal habitats and ecosystems thrive in environments with high concentrations of dissolved oxygen.

- **Concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria and Enterococci**. *Fecal coliform bacteria are found in human and animal intestines*. Higher levels of these bacteria can mean there is sewage-related water pollution. Though most fecal coliform bacteria do not cause disease, their concentrations are a good indicator of the presence of pathogenic (disease-producing) bacteria. **Enterococci** can survive in saltwater (harbor water is a mix of fresh and saltwater). Department of environmental protection scientists measure the concentrations of both groups of bacteria in both salt and fresh water.

### How we monitor harbor water quality

Water quality standards are set by New York State and monitored by the NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) annually through the Harbor Survey. The Harbor Survey Program has grown to include 40 sites throughout New York waters. These sites are sampled on a weekly basis during the summer season (May - October) and monthly during the winter season (November - April).

### New York's harbor water quality today

*Bacteria levels show that water meets minimum standards*

Since the 1990s, harbor-wide surface water fecal coliform levels have been well below the state standard for fishing and boating (2,000 cells per 100mL, from 5+ samples) and bathing and other recreation (200 cells per 100 mL from 5+ samples).

Since the NYC DEP began monitoring enterococci in the early 2000s, enterococci levels have remained better than the state bathing standard. Short-term spikes in bacteria may occur after heavy rain. 


*Dissolved oxygen levels show that water exceeds minimum standards*

NYC DEP reports the open water summer average levels of dissolved oxygen harbor-wide, from surface and bottom water, on an annual basis. Levels above the state standard (5.0 mg/L) indicate a harbor suitable to most aquatic life forms. Since the 1990s, the annual summer average for surface and bottom water dissolved oxygen levels of open water sites have been above New York State standards.
