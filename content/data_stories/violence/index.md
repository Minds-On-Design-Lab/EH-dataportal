Experiencing violence affects people in many ways. It not only causes physical injury or death, but being exposed to it can also cause emotional and psychological trauma. Violence doesn’t just affect the immediate victim, it affects their surrounding community, too.

Violence can affect people throughout their lives: it is associated with worse birth outcomes, childhood developmental delays, physical and mental illness, and premature deaths.

Violence is an epidemic, and with any epidemic, prevention is key. And like any health issue that leads to disability, disease and death, there is a role for public health and healthcare to play in preventing it.

A common understanding of violence can help promote public health approaches to violence prevention, and shift the focus from violence as a criminal behavior to instead viewing the experience of violence as a public health issue. Yes, violence is a behavior that some people do – but we’re focused on how people experience violence: the social and environmental contexts that predict whether they do, what happens as a result, and how we can protect them.

We can use data and research to understand what leads to violence, to advocate for and help implement strategies to reduce people’s exposure to violence - to keep them safe and prevent lifelong harm to their health.

### NYC's homicide rate has declined...
There is a lot less violence than there used to be in NYC. Note on the COVID-19 pandemic.

To look at violence, people often look at homicide rates. In recent years, NYC’s rate of homicides - the most extreme episodes of violence - has been under 5 per 100,000 people, down from a high of over 25 per 100,000 people from 1986-1990.

{{< datawrapper "NYC's Homicide Rate over time" "bqQeD/2/" "400">}}

### ...but a drop in the homicide rate doesn't tell the whole story.
In this chart, we look at three types of violent outcomes and how violence levels differ across the city: non-fatal assault emergency department visits, non-fatal assault hospitalizations, and homicides. These data show a larger burden of violence.

When broken down by geography, the data show that some neighborhoods experience violence at much higher rates than others. Neighborhoods experiencing the most violence have non-fatal assault hospitalization rates that are 10 times higher than neighborhoods experiencing the lowest rates – and 4 times higher than the citywide rate.

This pattern is consistent across the three indicators. And, neighborhoods that experience higher rates of violence have larger populations of people of color - showing that these populations shoulder a disproportionate burden of violence.

{{< datawrapper "NYC's violence rates" "PldhR/2/" "400">}}

{{< storyheader text="A public health approach to addressing violence" anchor="3">}}
Residents of some neighborhoods are at much greater risk of experiencing violence - and its many health effects.

To prevent violence among those most affected by it, we need to explore what factors lead to it.

### Violence is rooted in historical disinvestment and racism.
Evidence shows that violence results from social structures that limit access to basic needs - structures that are fueled by racism, residential segregation, and neighborhood disinvestment. Where these structures persist, people are exposed to violence. For example, low-income neighborhoods of color are known to be hit the hardest.

This map shows the parts of NYC that were redlined 90 years ago as part of racist housing policy that set off decades of disinvestment and intergenerational poverty.

A map of recent shootings lines up with the heavily redlined areas of the Bronx, Harlem, and northern and eastern Brooklyn - showing clearly how today's violence is closely related to the ways that racist policies are embedded in our society.

Decades of government and societal {{< rawhtml>}}<a href="#disinvestmentCollapse" data-toggle="collapse" class="badge badge-pill badge-warning">disinvestment</a>{{< /rawhtml>}} from practices like redlining means limited opportunity and resources, and results in higher rates of poverty in some neighborhoods.

{{< rawhtml>}}
<div class="collapse mb-2 drawerbg px-2 py-2 mx-2" id="disinvestmentCollapse">
<strong>Disinvestment</strong> is when either government agencies or private companies
deliberately withhold or withdraw resources and opportunity from a neighborhood or
community. </p>
<p>The history of disinvesment is tied to racist practices and policies - like denyng people
of color loans to buy homes. Disinvestment is also planned shrinkage, a steady decline
of public funding for public housing, services, education - especially in cities, and
especially in neighborhoods populated mostly by people of color.</p>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml>}}

As a result of this disinvestment, we see a clear relationship between poverty and violence. As a neighborhood's poverty level increases, so do assaults.

### Disinvestment creates environments that threaten health.
{{< rawhtml>}}<a href="#disinvestmentCollapseTwo" data-toggle="collapse" class="badge badge-pill badge-warning">Disinvestment takes many forms</a>{{< /rawhtml>}} It promotes segregation, limits people’s access to basic resources, and creates environments that threaten people’s health.

{{< rawhtml>}}
<div class="collapse py-2 px-2 mx-2 mb-2 drawerbg" id="disinvestmentCollapseTwo">
    <p>Disinvestment can be:
    <ul>
        <li>Denying people access to loans to buy homes - like <span

            well-documented racist real estate practices</li>
        <li>Housing neglect by landlords, leading to unhealthy housing</li>
        <li>Poorly-funded schools</li>
        <li>Fewer job opportunities and lower-paying jobs</li>
        <li>Emphasis on policing over pro-social resources</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml>}}

In terms of public health, we say that disinvestment produces environmental factors that make certain health outcomes more likely.

{{< /rawhtml>}}

Due to a history of disinvestment, New York City neighborhoods experience very different environmental factors that predict violence and other health outcomes.

By “environmental,” we mean the entire physical, social, and economic context around us: the built environment, like housing and parks, and access to schools, jobs, opportunity, healthcare, and more.

Whether or not a neighborhood experiences more violence can be explained by looking at whether its environment has protective factors, which help prevent violence before it starts, or risk factors, which make violence a more likely outcome.

{{< storyheader text="What does this mean for NYC's neighborhoods?" anchor="4">}}

NYC's neighborhoods experience these protective and risk factors very differently. Some neighborhoods have a lot less of the protective factors – and a lot more of the risk factors.

{{< rawhtml>}}
Let's explore how by comparing two neighborhoods: <span style="color: #b820bb; font-weight: bold;">Belmont/East Tremont</span>, in the Bronx, and <span style="color: #5c8ea5; font-weight: bold;">Tottenville/Great Kills</span>, in Staten Island.
