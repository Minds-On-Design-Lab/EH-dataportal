Add text here.

To add images, you can move them into this folder, and then use the code below (replacing imagename.jpg with the image name, and adding alt text).
`{{< figure src="imagename.jpg" alt="Alt text goes here" >}}`

Here's a markdown cheat sheet, for how to make headers, bold, italics, bullets, etc. [Cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). 

To preview it, change draft to "false" in the frontmatter (above). And then in the terminal, enter `hugo serve --environment local`. Then, go to https://localhost:1313/EH-dataportal.
