<i>In 2020, the NYC Health Department held a series of Community Conversations with residents and local stakeholders across 26 neighborhoods in the city. In these conversations New Yorkers share the personal stories that illuminate priorities for public health, healthy neighborhoods, and more from the people that they impact most. This is one part of a three-part series on how economic stability, public space, and housing create health.</i>

<strong>17 percent of New Yorkers, or about 1,400,000 people, live in poverty.</strong> Living in poverty impacts health in many ways. These include: 

* Financial and emotional stress: medical debt and making difficult choices between rent, food, medical care, and bills. 

* Unhealthy and unstable housing conditions: illness from increased exposure to weather-related illnesses from not being able to afford air conditioning or heat.  

* Food insecurity: lack of access to fresh food or enough food. 

The combined effects of poverty are increased sickness and death.  

### Premature deaths rates are twice as high in poor neighborhoods as in wealthier ones

### Poverty forces people to do without necessities that keep them healthy, like food and medical care.

<strong>Nearly one-third of renting households in the City experience severe rent burden</strong>—spending at least half their income on rent.  

We see severe rent burden among New Yorkers of all income levels—but low-income people feel these effects more. Severe rent burden impacts nearly half (44%) of households that earn between $25,000 and $50,000, and 85% of households that earn less than $25,000. People who are rent burdened must make difficult choices between housing and health. For example, they may choose not to use an air conditioner because of the electricity bill <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/heat/">despite this increasing their risk for heat-related illness and death.</a>

### One out of every 10 New Yorkers experiences food insecurity.

Low-income New Yorkers also have to make tradeoffs when it comes to food. <strong>Food insecurity</strong> (not always having enough food) became even worse during the COVID-19 pandemic.   

Our health is shaped not just by having enough food to eat but also by having the right foods to eat. NYC is known for its bodegas, but they don’t always offer healthy staples. For foods that make up a healthy diet, New Yorkers need grocery stores. But most high-poverty neighborhoods in NYC have more bodegas than grocery stores – making healthier food harder to access than unhealthy food.

<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/neighborhood-health/shop-health.page">The City’s Shop Healthy NYC!</a> initiative encourages residents to talk to their bodega owners about offering more healthy options. 

### With no money to spare after rent and food, many New Yorkers go without the health care or medicines they need. 

Residents living in high-poverty neighborhoods are more likely to postpone health care. By going without these services, diseases can be more difficult to prevent, catch early, and treat, leading to more serious and costly health conditions.

Getting essential health care can mean the difference between staying afloat and winding up in medical debt.  

<div class="pullquote">
<figure class="my-2">
    <figcaption>“You go to some of these facilities and they tell they don’t take your insurance. I’m with my [11-year-old] child and even then, [it’s], ‘no, we don’t take that insurance.’ It’s like, oh my God, what world am I in? Where do I go?” </figcaption>

Getting care for a medical issue can be costly, even with insurance. Medical debt occurs when people can’t pay bills. If the bills go unpaid long enough, they get sent to collection agencies, which can impact credit scores. 

### Medical debt creates stress and disproportionately affects people of color.  

Six percent of all New Yorkers—about 1 in 20 people—have medical debt in collections. People living in communities of color tend to experience a higher rate of, and owe more money in, medical debt than people living in White communities. In Brooklyn, for example, <a href="https://apps.urban.org/features/debt-interactive-map/?type=medical&variable=medcoll&state=36&county=36047">communities of color have double the amount of residents with medical debt in collections.</a> 

Chronic stress related to finances can be debilitating because the factors causing it are difficult to resolve, and many worsen over time. Long-term stress increases the risk of mental health issues and other health problems.  

Racism shapes who experiences poverty—and its health effects—in NYC.  

In NYC, as in most places in the United States, there are more Black and Latino residents living in poverty than residents of other races. <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/housing/">This is a product of racism</a> and a history of policies that deprive people of color of access to home ownership, education and jobs, and other opportunities to build wealth and economic stability.

This <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/racial-wealth-gap/">racial wealth gap</a> persists across the United States, and results in health inequities. White New Yorkers are much less likely than New Yorkers of color to report their health as fair or poor.

Public health is about searching for and addressing the root causes of different health outcomes. The data are clear, and so are the personal stories that were shared: increasing economic stability would greatly improve health for New Yorkers.
