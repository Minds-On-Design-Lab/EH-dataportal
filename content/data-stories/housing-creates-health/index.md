In 2020, the NYC Health Department held a series of Community Conversations with residents and local stakeholders across 26 neighborhoods in the city. In these conversations New Yorkers share the personal stories that illuminate priorities for bridging the gap between public health and communities: how to build healthier neighborhoods, healthier childhoods and more, from the people that impact most. This is one part of a three-part series on how <strong>economic stability, public space, and housing</strong> create health.

Quality housing supports health and safety, can lower stress, and provides a sense of security and stability. But for some New Yorkers, their housing situation exposes them to health risks, creates financial and mental stress, and makes them vulnerable to displacement.

The impacts of poor housing build up over the course of people’s lives. And the major, pervasive housing issues<strong>—quality, affordability, and stability—</strong>have a greater impact on health at key stages of life, like childhood and old age, and on <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-explorer/economic-conditions/?id=103#display=summary">people living in higher-poverty neighborhoods.</a> People of color disproportionately experience injustices related to poor housing and environmental hazards as a result of systemic racism through policies like redlining and blockbusting.

### Housing affordability: lack of affordable housing forces difficult choices between essentials

Household income is increasing at a much slower rate than rent and residents are struggling to keep up with the cost of housing and other necessities.

Across New York, half of all households are rent-burdened, leaving less money for food and basic health care. People are considered rent-burdened when more than 30% of their household income goes to rent. <a href="src"> Learn more about the health implications of experiencing rent burden in How economic stability creates health.</a>

A high rent burden is often accompanied by other housing issues like overcrowding (defined as more than one person per room). Overcrowding occurs much more often in high-poverty areas, and can compound the spread of disease.

### Housing quality: More than half of renter-occupied homes in NYC have health-related maintenance problems.

When housing is unaffordable, options become limited and people often end up in lower-quality housing with maintenance and/or pest issues that can cause or worsen health conditions.

<div class="pullquote my-4">
<figure class="">
    <figcaption figcaption class="mb-2"> “We didn’t have any heat for last year up until the middle of December. And then we didn’t have any air conditioning through the middle of August.” <br><span class="float-right">—NYC community conversation participant</span> </figcaption>
    <audio controls src="clip-ac-and-heat.mp3" style="width:100%;" class="mt-2">

                Download audio
            </a>
    </audio>
</figure>
</div>

Without proper maintenance, these homes fail to address or develop health hazards, including:

- Lead and other toxins, which can cause behavioral and brain problems in children. Lead can also cause increased blood pressure, kidney and brain problems, infertility, and impotence in adults.

- Pests, like cockroaches and mice, which can make food unclean and contribute to the worsening of asthma and its symptoms.

- Lack of air conditioning, which can cause heat stress making existing health conditions worse and, in extreme cases, resulting in hospitalization and even death.

- Lack of heat, which can cause hypothermia (a dangerously low body temperature) and worsen heart disease and other medical problems.

<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/asthma-housing-2021.pdf">Home maintenance issues are more common in high-poverty neighborhoods and in public housing than in wealthier neighborhoods or privately-owned apartments.</a>

The consequences of these disparities can be dangerous. For example, people whose homes lack adequate heating might use space heaters, which are a fire risk. In January 2022, a malfunctioning space heater sparked a fire that killed 17 people in a high-rise building in the Bronx.

### Housing instability: When housing isn’t affordable, people’s living situations become unstable.  

A lack of affordable and healthy housing often leads to unstable housing. Most evictions occur because people can’t pay rent. The resulting impacts of moving frequently, eviction, and homelessness all threaten health both in the short term and over time. New Yorkers living in high-poverty neighborhoods experience eviction at more than four times the rate of those living in low-poverty neighborhoods.

Eviction is associated with many poor health outcomes. These include babies that are born too small or early, and a higher rate of infant death. Adults who have been evicted have worse physical and mental health, go to the emergency department more often, and are more likely to die by suicide. 

Even the possibility of eviction raises the likelihood that someone will report poor health, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress.

### High-quality, affordable, and stable housing is essential to public health.

When COVID-19 hit, New York paused evictions, recognizing the twin threats of serious financial hardship and health risks created and made worse through experiencing homelessness. This was an effort to keep people housed—but also to keep people out of shelters, where the spread of COVID was hard to contain.

<div class="my-4 py-2 border-top border-bottom">
<iframe title="Evictions plummeted in 2020" class="" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-xy1ku" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xy1ku/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="423" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
</div>

When the eviction pause ended in 2021, homelessness in NYC began to rise at a staggering rate, with Black and Latino residents affected more than other racial groups. This happened amid a backdrop of steadily increasing rates of homelessness over the past two decades, with roots that extend beyond the pandemic.

Implementing programs that incorporate similar strategies coupled with expanding housing options could help reduce homelessness now and in the future.

The NYC Health Department has a supportive housing program offering 11,200 permanent, affordable housing units for people with substance use or mental health diagnoses who are at risk of homelessness. Supportive housing is also available for people who have been homeless for extended periods of time and includes those coming from street outreach and shelters, foster care, the legal system, and more. In addition to a roof, supportive housing offers tenants assistance in getting jobs, reuniting with families, and getting treatment and support. The City also offers public housing, which houses more than 400,000 low-income New Yorkers—1 in every 11 renters—in over 174,000 public housing units.

### To protect the health and well-being of all New Yorkers, we need to ensure that every resident has access to high-quality, affordable housing.

Effective policy must take into consideration how individual needs are shaped by their experience and can also change at every stage of life. Accessibility and support for older adults should be part of housing discussions too. <a href="https://wherewelive.cityofnewyork.us/">The NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development undertook the Where We Live (WWL) project to hear from residents, government, and community leaders </a> about their experiences with housing access, accessibility, and discrimination. WWL initiatives draw on this feedback to <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/housing/"> prioritize the equitable expansion of housing opportunities in neighborhoods harmed by structural racism.</a>

Also, individuals can call 311 to report health and safety hazards and problems that landlords must legally address.

In summary, when housing is...

- Safe and comfortable

- Affordable and stable

- High-quality

...it supports mental, physical, and emotional health.
