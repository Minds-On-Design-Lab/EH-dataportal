Lead is a harmful metal that can cause serious health problems. When lead poisoning makes headlines, the focus is usually onc hildren's health: kids are at higher risk for lead exposure, which can cause developmental, learning and behavior problems.

**But lead can also harm adults.**

In adults, lead can cause increased blood pressure, kidney and brain problems, infertility and impotence. During pregnancy, lead exposure can cause miscarriage or babies to be born too soon or too small.

There is no safe level of lead exposure: even low levels of lead in the bloodcan cause health problems, and lead can build up in the body over time with more exposure.

Most people with elevated blood lead levels don't look or feel sick, which can make it hard to identify. The only way to know if oyu have been exposed ot lead is to get a blood lead test.

**The good news: Blood lead levels among New Yorkers are declining.**

This continued drop in blood lead levels id likely due to work that redced lead exosures from food, water, air, leaded paint and consumer products.

STricter laws and regulations, prevention strategies such as screening at-risk populations and public education and outreach have helped.

For example, New York State law requires that health care providers check pregnant women for lead exosure, and test those at risk. And, federal law requires employers tomonitor workers at risk for lead exposure because of their job.

**Even with improvements, adult lead poisoning remains a persistent problem.**
Between 2016 and 2018, about 1,750 New Yorkers age 16 or older had blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per decileter or higher, a rate of 15 people per 100,000.

*In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted a blood lead level of 10 or higher as the definition for an elevated blood lead level for adults.*

When somebody is tested for lead in the blood, the NYC Health Department receives the results. When we learn that somebody has an elevated blood lead level, we start an investigation. We ask a long listof questions to find out how the person was exposed to lead and recommend ways for the person to protect themselves.

This helps us protect New Yorkers, and learn about ways that people can get exposed. Here's what we have found:

In NYC, the most common source of lead exposure among non-pregnant adults is from **construction-related jobs**. Workers can breathe in or ingest lead dust or fumes during renovations, repairs and demolitions that disturb old lead-based paint. Work or hobbies related to metalwork, antique restoration, firearms or crafts involving materials with lead can also put adults at risk.

**Consumer prodcuts can also expose people to lead**. During our investigations, we pay special attention to consumer products from other countries: certain health remedies, foods and spices, cultural powders and traditional cook ware. We've found that lead is sometimes added to these products, either accidentally or intentionally. Lead is typically not listed on the label, so it's hard to tell the difference bewteen safe and dangerous products. [More information about hazardous products](www.nyc.gov/hazardousproducts).

As part of our investigations, we work to get these products off NYC store shelves before they endanger people. This means we:
- Routinely visit shops where we think lead contianing products might be sold
- Trace hazardous products back to the stores where people bought them, if reportedly purchased in NYC
- Take action when we find hazardous products for sale.

We buy products from NYC stores and send them to a lab for testing. When we identify a product that has more lead than the allowable limits, we take enforcement actions to protect New Yorkers. We order the shops to stop selling the contaminated products and require them to post warning signs to inform their customers about the dangers of these products. 

All in all, since 2010, we've surveyed over 1,800 businesses and removed **over 30,000 hazardous consumer products** from store shelves. [Get more data on consumer products we tested](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Metal-Content-of-Consumer-Products-Tested-by-the-N/da9u-wz3r/data).

**One type of product that's more likely to contain lead are spices purchased abroad.**

A Health Department study on spices collected during investigations between 2008 and 2017, including nearly 1,500 samples of spices from 41 countries, found that more than half of spice samples had detectable lead concentrations. About one-third of the samples had a lead level higher than 2 parts per million (ppm), the permissible limit for lead in food additives.

Our data shows that spices purchased abroad are more than **3 times as likely** to exceed the permissible amount fompared with spices purchased at stores in the USA. Spices sold in stores in the USA are subject to regulatory oversight, such as border control checks and surveillance by state and federal agencies, which likely decreases the chance of lead contamination in those products.

We recommend that New Yorkers buy their spices locally.

**It's not just spices.**

We have also investigated numerous cases of lead poisoning in children and adults associated with using:
[DROPDOWN PILLS]

Certain immigrant communities in NYC are at higher risk of lead exposure. For example, South Asians in NYC are more likely to have elevated blood lead levels compared to the rest of NYC. In addition to lead paint and occupational lead hazards, poisonings in this community have been associated with using traditional consumer products.

**Take steps to protect yourself and your family from lead exposure.**

If you do construction, metal work, antique restoration or other work or hobbies that might bring you into contact with lead:
- Use protective clothing and a proper respirator, and follow all safety protocols
- Wash your hands and face before eating, drinking, or smoking
- Avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in the work area
- Wash your work clothing separately from household laundry.

**Avoid consumer products that may contain lead.** 

If you think you or your family members are at risk for lead poisoning, ask your doctor for a blood lead test. Remind your provider to test your child for lead poisoning at age 1 and 2, and ask about testing older children. If you need help finding a doctor, call 311.
