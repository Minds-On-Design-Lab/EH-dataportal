Health is determined by many factors, and people tend to be healthier when they have economic stability, live in quality housing and have access to public space and safe, connected communities. In 2020, the NYC Health Department held a series of community conversations with residents and local stakeholders across 26 neighborhoods. New Yorkers shared personal stories that illuminate their priorities for building healthier neighborhoods, healthier childhoods and more. This is one part of a three-part series on how <strong> housing, <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/economic-stability/"> economic stability </a> and public space create health.</strong>

or most New Yorkers, their own backyard isn’t typically a fenced-in lawn or a private patio—it’s the city. Our public spaces are our streets, sidewalks, parks, pools, waterfront, plazas, subways, beaches, and other places that are open to all. These spaces help us get from point A to point B and offer opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, be active, play, connect with others, and just be.

At their best, NYC public spaces are clean, safe, pleasant, accessible to everyone, and promote health and well-being for all.

Public spaces that are designed to reflect community priorities advance equity for all residents, and support health and well-being.

### When streets are designed with everybody in mind—regardless of their age, type of transportation, or mobility—we all benefit.

Covering 8,000 miles, streets make up most of the public space in NYC. Cars and other motor vehicles dominate these many miles of public space. <a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/indicators/Car_access?geo=07000000003651000&breakdown=by-race-ethnicity">Fifty-five of New York City households do not have a car </a> and only 41% of adults report having driven a car in the past 30 days. People in vehicles use most of the space on the roads but people outside of vehicles have the most roadway deaths. In New York City each year, more pedestrians die in road crashes than drivers or passengers. In addition, <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/transportation-related-injuries/?id=2094#display=summary"> each￼year there are more than 8,000 emergency department visits for pedestrian injuries.</a> In places where New York City has redesigned streets there have been fewer injuries.

<div class="bg-light px-2 py-2 my-4">
<strong> Vision Zero </strong><br>
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/visionzero/pages/"> Redesigning streets for safety is a key part of Vision Zero, </a> New York City’s effort to eliminate roadway deaths and serious injuries. As part of Vision Zero, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/safeseniors.shtml"> Pedestrian safety initiatives like Safe Streets for Seniors, study crash data, conduct outreach, and develop ways to increase safety for all road users.</a>

### Designing streets for people walking and biking—not just people using cars—can improve safety.

In areas with more bike safety infrastructure (including bike lanes and protected bike lanes), we see more people traveling by bike and lower rates of bike injuries. This is the case in Manhattan, which has more than double the number of bike lanes as Brooklyn and a correspondingly lower rate of bicycle injury ED visits although both boroughs have similar percentages of bike commuters.

### Housing quality: Over half of renter-occupied homes in NYC have health-related maintenance problems.

When housing is unaffordable, options become limited, and people often end up in lower-quality housing with maintenance deficiencies that can cause or worsen health conditions.

<div class="pullquote my-4">
<figure class="">
    <figcaption figcaption class="mb-2"> “I think the parks need to be safer. I do not think more policing is the answer to it, but I do think there needs to be more around, like, making those kinds of public spaces safer for kids and families to engage in.” <br><span class="float-right"></span> </figcaption>

The consequences of these deficiencies can be dangerous. For example, people whose homes lack adequate heating might use space heaters, which are a fire risk. In January 2022, a malfunctioning space heater sparked a fire that killed 17 people in a high-rise building in the Bronx.

Affordability and barriers to cooling can also result in consequences to health. Lack of air conditioning can result in heat stress during warmer weather and periods of extreme heat, making existing health conditions worse and, in extreme cases, resulting in hospitalization and even death.

### Housing instability: when people’s living situations become unstable their mental and physical health is at stake.

A lack of affordable housing often leads to housing instability. Most evictions occur because the tenant can’t pay rent, and can result in frequent moves and homelessness, both of which threaten health in the short term and over time. New Yorkers living in high-poverty neighborhoods experience eviction at more than four times the rate of those living in low-poverty neighborhoods.

<a href ="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20210315.747908/"> Eviction is associated with many poor health outcomes.</a> These include babies that are born too small or early, and a higher rate of infant death. Adults who have been evicted have worse physical and mental health, go to the emergency department more often, and are more likely to die by suicide.

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9502670/"> A person facing even the possibility of eviction is more likely to report poor health, </a> including high blood pressure, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress.

When COVID-19 hit, New York City paused evictions, recognizing the twin threats of serious financial hardship and health risks created and made worse through experiencing homelessness. This was an effort to keep people housed — but also to keep people out of shelters, where the spread of COVID was hard to contain.

When the eviction pause ended in 2021, homelessness in NYC began to rise at a staggering rate, with Black and Latino residents affected more than other racial groups. <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/facts-about-homelessness/#:~:text=In%20November%202023%2C%2092%2C824%20people,see%20the%20shelter%20census%20breakdown.&text=In%20November%202023%2C%2021%2C769%20families,breakdown%20of%20the%20census%20below."> This happened amid a backdrop of steadily increasing rates of homelessness over the past two decades, with roots that extend beyond the pandemic.</a>

Implementing programs that incorporate similar strategies coupled with expanding housing options could help reduce homelessness now and in the future.

The NYC Health Department has a supportive housing program offering 11,200 permanent, affordable housing units for people with substance use or mental health diagnoses who are at risk of homelessness. Supportive housing is also available for people who have been homeless for extended periods of time and includes those coming from street outreach and shelters, foster care, the legal system, and more. In addition to a roof, supportive housing offers tenants assistance in getting jobs, reuniting with families, and getting treatment and support. The City also offers public housing, which houses more than 400,000 low-income New Yorkers—1 in every 11 renters—in over 174,000 public housing units.

### High-quality, affordable and stable housing is essential to public health.

Effective policy must take into consideration how individual needs are shaped by their experience and can also change at every stage of life. Accessibility and support for older adults should be part of housing discussions too. <a href="https://wherewelive.cityofnewyork.us/">The NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development undertook the Where We Live (WWL) project to hear from residents, government, and community leaders </a> about their experiences with housing access, accessibility, and discrimination. WWL initiatives draw on this feedback to <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/housing/"> prioritize the equitable expansion of housing opportunities in neighborhoods harmed by structural racism.</a>

Also, individuals can call 311 to report health and safety hazards and problems that landlords must legally address.

In summary, when housing is...

- Safe and comfortable

- Affordable and stable

- High-quality

...it supports mental, physical, and emotional health.
