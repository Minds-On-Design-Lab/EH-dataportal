Health is determined by many factors, and people tend to be healthier when they have economic stability, live in quality housing and have access to public space and safe, connected communities. In 2020, the NYC Health Department held a series of community conversations with residents and local stakeholders across 26 neighborhoods. New Yorkers shared personal stories that illuminate their priorities for building healthier neighborhoods, healthier childhoods and more. This is one part of a three-part series on how <strong> housing, <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/economic-stability/"> economic stability </a> and public space create health.</strong>

For most New Yorkers, their own backyard isn’t typically a fenced-in lawn or a private patio—it’s the city. Our public spaces are our streets, sidewalks, parks, pools, waterfront, plazas, subways, beaches, and other places that are open to all. These spaces help us get from point A to point B and offer opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, be active, play, connect with others, and just be.

At their best, NYC public spaces are clean, safe, pleasant, accessible to everyone, and promote health and well-being for all.

Public spaces that are designed to reflect community priorities advance equity for all residents, and support health and well-being.

### When streets are designed with everybody in mind—regardless of their age, type of transportation, or mobility—we all benefit.

Covering 8,000 miles, streets make up most of the public space in NYC. Cars and other motor vehicles dominate these many miles of public space. <a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/indicators/Car_access?geo=07000000003651000&breakdown=by-race-ethnicity">Fifty-five of New York City households do not have a car </a> and only 41% of adults report having driven a car in the past 30 days. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/visionzero/downloads/pdf/vision-zero-year-7-report.pdf"> People in vehicles use most of the space on the roads but people outside of vehicles have the most roadway deaths.</a> In New York City each year, more pedestrians die in road crashes than drivers or passengers. In addition, <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/transportation-related-injuries/?id=2094#display=summary"> each￼year there are more than 8,000 emergency department visits for pedestrian injuries.</a> In places where New York City has redesigned streets there have been fewer injuries.

<div class="bg-light px-2 py-2 my-4">
<strong> Vision Zero </strong><br>
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/visionzero/pages/"> Redesigning streets for safety is a key part of Vision Zero, </a> New York City’s effort to eliminate roadway deaths and serious injuries. As part of Vision Zero, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/safeseniors.shtml"> Pedestrian safety initiatives like Safe Streets for Seniors, study crash data, conduct outreach, and develop ways to increase safety for all road users.</a>

### Designing streets for people walking and biking—not just people using cars—can improve safety.

<a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/streets/"> In areas with more bike safety infrastructure (including bike lanes and protected bike lanes), we see more people traveling by bike and lower rates of bike injuries.</a> This is the case in Manhattan, which has more than double the number of bike lanes as Brooklyn and a correspondingly lower rate of bicycle injury ED visits although both boroughs have similar percentages of bike commuters.

New Yorkers own fewer cars than people in many other U.S. cities. That means our streets and sidewalks provide a special opportunity (and responsibility) to make active forms of transit like walking, biking, and e-biking more dependable, functional, and appealing. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/active-design-guidelines/adguidelines.pdf">The Active Design Guidelines provide evidence-informed strategies to promote health through the design of the built environment.</a> The guidelines help designers and planners think about the best way to design streets and the public realm to make it easy, safe, and comfortable to cycle, walk, and use other forms of active transit to get around. This includes infrastructure like protected bike lanes and well-maintained sidewalks that provide connections and access to plazas, parks, open spaces, and the City’s public spaces inclusive of all New Yorkers regardless of identity or ability. The guidelines align and build upon design guidelines and ongoing initiatives at NYC Department of Transportation and NYC Parks. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/pedestrian-mobility.shtml">The NYC Pedestrian Mobility Plan incorporates pedestrian needs into different street types to create a more comfortable and convenient experience.</a> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/nyc-streets-plan-update-2023.pdf">The NYCStreetsPlan addresses street safety through inspections, added accessible signals, and bike lanes.</a>

### Lowering levels of air, noise, and light pollution from roadway and commercial activity help us stay healthy in our shared environment.

Neighborhoods closest to highways are impacted by increased noise and air pollution and experience long-term consequences from the fracturing of communities that result from highway construction in the first place. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/919-22/mayor-adams-kicks-off-landmark-study-reimagine-cross-bronx-expressway#/0">Community-informed impact studies on highways like the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (BQE) and the Cross Bronx Expressway (CBE) will work to mitigate the degree of these negative effects.</a> They aim to increase connectivity and resource access for those living close to a highway while reducing exposure to noise and pollution.

<a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/breatheeasy/">Though New York City’s air quality is overall improving, air quality can vary between neighborhoods due to a variety of factors,</a> such as their traffic levels, heating oil use, tree canopy, and local green space. All neighborhoods can benefit from strategic car-free zones, including greenways for bicycle and pedestrian access, and increased street trees along roadways, which have been associated with cleaner air; and policies that reduce vehicle traffic which can result in reduced noise, light, and air pollution, and encourage active transit.

### Maintaining public spaces is critical to ensuring that all New Yorkers can use them.

<figure class="">
    <figcaption figcaption class="mb-2"> “It’s not enough that there are structures like parks and sidewalks...But there needs to be upkeep, it needs to be clean for people to actually want to access the parks and sidewalks to keep their health maintained.” <br><span class="float-right"></span>

<a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/sanitation/"> Clean, well-maintained, and attractive public spaces are essential to maximize the benefits to public health. </a> Broken equipment and seating, cracked and uneven sidewalks, trash, pests, and other unsanitary things on the streets or in parks may make these spaces feel unsafe, discourage play for neighborhood residents, spread disease, and impact mental health. <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/parks-inspection-program">Parks also need to be well-maintained, and have enough waste bins, public restrooms, and water fountains to support activities like fitness classes, sports, and community events. </a> NYC Parks has a program that inspects their properties for maintenance issues and the NYC Department of Transportation responds to maintenance issues of streets and sidewalks and coordinates with the Department of Sanitation for waste pick-up. Additional maintenance complaints can be filed via 311.

### Public spaces should be designed with all New Yorkers in mind.

Public spaces have countless benefits and should be inclusive for all. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967628/"> Outdoor physical activity and socialization have been shown to increase brain function, boost confidence and self-esteem, and lower stress in adolescents.</a> Where trees, grass, and shrubs are found, outdoor temperatures are cooler, helping fight the urban heat island effect and making streets and public spaces more comfortable. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/genderequity/downloads/pdf/cge-tip-card-public-spaces.pdf"> Public spaces designed with gender inclusion in mind help create a welcoming and safe environment for everyone that visits them. </a> Lighting, sight lines, signage, available facilities, and other amenities can be designed to meet the needs of visitors of all ages, interests, and abilities.

Designing public spaces for people also means creating parks, pools, and other recreation areas that everyone can access. In most NYC neighborhoods, residents live within walking distance (within a half a mile) to a park. But in some neighborhoods, residents still don’t have this level of access to public space.

<div class="my-4 py-2 border-top border-bottom">
<iframe title="In most neighborhoods, residents live within walking distance to a park" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-h8KUM" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/h8KUM/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="781" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
</div>

As of 2023, 84.6% of New Yorkers live within walking distance to a park. <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/planning-and-building/planning/walk-to-a-park"> Resources are being directed to increasing the number of New Yorkers that live in walking distance to a park through the Walk to a Park Initiative.</a> Park access is hugely beneficial to everyone, but not everyone feels equally comfortable using this form of public space and many report harassment based on race or housing status.

#### Feeling safe in public space helps people enjoy and use them.

<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/environmental/promoting-safety.pdf"> Whether people perceive their neighborhood as safe can affect how comfortable they feel spending time outside, using parks, and using active transit.</a> Perceptions of safety can also affect residents’ mental well-being. People who live in high-poverty neighborhoods are much less likely to perceive their neighborhoods as safe than people who live in low-poverty neighborhoods. Disinvestment can create unsafe conditions over time, which can connect to these perceptions.

### NYC’s public spaces are the building blocks of our city and our lives.

As places everyone uses and depends on daily, prioritizing community engagement in the development and planning of these building blocks is critical to their success. Such engagement builds trust and accountability and is an essential part of environmental justice work and advancing equity at the city level. When public space is built with community representation, it better reflects meaningful priorities, lived experiences, and local culture.
