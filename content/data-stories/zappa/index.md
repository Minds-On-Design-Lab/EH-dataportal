# How do we know what air quality policies will have the biggest effect?  

New York City’s air quality is generally good and has been improving over time. Still, air pollution threatens health: two pollutants, ozone and PM2.5, [cause about 2400 deaths per year in NYC](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/Subtopic.aspx?theme_code=2,3&subtopic_id=103), and thousands more emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma, heart, and lung problems.  

It’s important to clean up the air to protect New Yorkers, and we know how to do it: reducing emissions from power plants, buildings, vehicles, restaurants, and other sources of pollutants.  

But air quality is complicated. How do we decide what policies to push for? How do we know what will have the greatest benefits to New Yorkers? 

One tool we can use is called ZAPPA (the ZIP Code Air Pollution Policy Assessment tool). 

ZAPPA uses emissions data and atmospheric chemistry models to predict policy effects. By entering emissions changes in specific ZIP Codes, we can use ZAPPA to estimate the resulting changes in air quality, air quality-related health outcomes, and economic effects. This tool bypasses the usual weeks of computer modeling time and advanced education needed in the past to find these results. ZAPPA lets policy planners figure out what neighborhoods to prioritize, and what neighborhoods stand to benefit the most. So, we can use ZAPPA to look at different scenarios, and help us understand the potential impacts - down to individual ZIP Codes. 

## How do we use ZAPPA to assess the impact of policy changes? 

Let’s use ZAPPA to test a few different scenarios.  

**Scenario 1: What if we eliminated electric power generation in NYC?** 

Electric power generation releases pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, which help create PM2.5. Eliminating means NYC would get its power from renewable sources like hydropower, wind, or solar power. 

Using ZAPPA, we can “zero out” emissions from electric power generation in all of NYC. (See step-by-step instructions for how to do this, below.)

**Results:** 


<div class="my-4">

|**Reductions in:**| Value |
|-------------|----------------|
|**PM2.5 (citywide average)**| 0.12 µg/m3|  
|**Deaths**| **5**  *per 1,000,000 people 30 and above per year* |
|**Asthma ED visits**| **9**  *per 1,000,000 people per year*|
</div>

When we enter this scenario into ZAPPA, it shows that PM2.5 would go down by 0.12 µg/m3 across the city. This policy change would prevent 5 deaths per 1,000,000 people aged 30 and above. Another common metric related to air pollutants is emergency department (ED) visits for asthma. This policy change would avoid 9 asthma ED visits per 1,000,000 people. 	 

## Looking at which ZIP Codes stand to benefit the most 

So, we’ve looked at an NYC-wide policy, but let’s dig deeper and use ZAPPA to analyze zip-code specific changes. Let’s take another scenario. 

**Scenario 2: Creating car-free zones.**

What if Midtown were a car-free zone? How would that compare to creating a car-free zone in the South Bronx? And, what if we eliminated vehicle traffic in the whole city?  

 
**Explanation:**	About 17% of PM2.5 comes from cars and trucks, and there are other health issues associated with traffic congestion (link to Congestion Pricing data story). 

Midtown has some of the worst air quality in all of NYC, while the South Bronx has some of the worst health impacts of air quality outcomes in all of NYC. So, what is the health impact of creating car-free zones in these neighborhoods?

**Results:**	 
</div>
<div class="wide my-4">

|**Reductions in:**|**NYC**|**Midtown**|**South Bronx**|
|-------------|----------------|-------|------------|
|**PM2.5 (average)**|0.46 µg/m3 |0.85 µg/m3 |0.20 µg/m3|
|**Deaths** |**20**  *per 1,000,000 people 30 and above per year* |**37**  *per 1,000,000 people 30 and above per year* |**12**  *per 1,000,000 people 30 and above per year*|
|**Asthma ED visits** |**20**  *per 1,000,000 people per year* |**19**  *per 1,000,000 people per year* |**33**  *per 1,000,000 people per year*|

</div>
<div class="narrow">

If we stopped traffic from entering any part of NYC, we would experience an average decrease of 0.46 µg/m3 in PM2.5 citywide. ZAPPA also estimates that there would be 20 fewer deaths per 1,000,000 for people aged 30 and above, and 20 emergency department visits for asthma avoided per 1,000,000 people in NYC. 

If we just stopped traffic from entering Midtown, we would see PM2.5 go down an average of 0.85 µg/m3 in those ZIP Codes. We would also reduce deaths by about 37 deaths per 1,000,000 people aged 30 and above and avoid about 19 ED visits for asthma per 1,000,000 people in Midtown.  

If we only stopped traffic from entering the South Bronx, we would see PM2.5 go down an average of 0.20 µg/m3 in the corresponding ZIP Codes. We would also reduce deaths by 12 deaths per 1,000,000 people aged 30 and above and avoid almost 33 ED visits for asthma per 1,000,000 people in the South Bronx.

Compared to Midtown, the South Bronx has a smaller average reduction in PM2.5 but a higher reduction in emergency department visits for asthma in this traffic scenario. 

## Key takeaways 

Policy makers and program planners across city agencies, community advocates, researchers, and stakeholders can use this tool to analyze neighborhood effects of a variety of policies and inform their policy development, program planning, and advocacy with stronger data.  

Targeting policy changes in neighborhoods that have poorer health outcomes attributable to air quality is more important than targeting policy in neighborhoods with poorer air quality [link to new HIA data story]. ZAPPA helps us see these improvements in health outcomes before we enact new policies, so we can center equity in public health measures.

## Step-by-Step: How do we use ZAPPA? 

**First, create an account.**
Your estimates and results will be saved to your account. 

**Next, start a new run.**  
Select Start a new NYC run. Give it a name and description - the model and results will be saved to your account.  

**Select ZIP Codes.**
These are the ZIP Codes you’d like to focus on. 

{{< figure src="Zappa1.png" alt="Left hand side has a menu with dropdowns. Top to bottom it says: Name and Description, ZIP Codes and waterways, Modify Traffic & Emissions, Advanced, and Review changes. The right hand side has a map of NYC with all ZIP Codes outlined in yellow." >}}

For the scenarios in this data story, here’s what we used:

*Power generation scenario*: All ZIP Codes

*Car-free scenarios*:
- NYC: all ZIP Codes
- Midtown: 10001, 10016, 10017, 10018, 10019, 10022, 10036
- South Bronx: 10451, 10452, 10454, 10455, 10456, 10474

Then, Select Traffic & Emissions Types 

Next, you’ll tell ZAPPA what traffic or emissions you want to change, and how. Click through the menus for different tiers and options. This can get complicated, and may require a lot of knowledge about a proposed policy - like how much it will actually affect emissions or traffic. 

 *For the scenarios in this data story, here’s what we used:*
 
|        | Power generation scenario         | Car-free scenario |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | Fuel Combustion: Electric Utility |  Highway vehicles |
| Tier 2 | All                               | All               |
| Tier 3 | N/A                               | N/A               |

{{< figure src="Zappa2.png" alt="The menu with dropdown has "All ZIP Codes" selected". The "Modify Traffic & Emissions" also open and can be edited." >}}


**Next, Input emissions or traffic change**

Select Set emissions changes. You’ll have the option of changing emissions by a specific amount of tons per year, or just by a percent change. For some scenarios, you would change the emissions while for others, you would set traffic changes. 

*For the scenarios in this data story, here’s what we used:* 

|                   | Power generation scenario | Car-free scenario                |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Emissions changes | -100% for each pollutant  | N/A                              |
| Traffic changes   | N/A                       | Electric fuel source**:          |
|                   |                           | 87.46 for passenger vehicles     |
|                   |                           | 4.98 for small commercial trucks |
|                   |                           | 0.43 for school buses            |
|                   |                           | 0.99 for transit buses           |
|                   |                           | 4.69 for large commercial trucks |
|                   |                           | 1.45 for other large trucks      |

| * If we eliminated all electric power generation within NYC, we would remove all related emissions. To represent this emissions change in ZAPPA, we would zero out the pollutants by getting the pollutant modified value to 0 under “Set Emissions Changes”. This change can be done using the percent change or specifying ton per year change.                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ** If we created car-free zones, we would change Fleet Mix so there is no gasoline, diesel, CNG or E-85 use. Preserve each row’s percent distribution and move it into “Electric”. Moving the fleet mix distributions into “electric” in this way means there are no pollutant emissions from those other fuel sources, effectively modeling that there is no vehicle traffic on the street.  |

 
Set Emissions Changes 
{{< figure src="Zappa3.png" alt="Grey window that says  "Set Emissions Changes" and "Fuel Combustion: Electric Utility" with Pollutant, Percent Change, Base Value, Modified Value, and Change as column headers.

[can we make traffic screenshots into a toggle?] 
Set Traffic Changes
{{< figure src="Zappa4.png" alt="Grey window that says  "Set Traffic Changes" and "Fleet Mix" with Vehicle type, Gasoline, Diesel, CNG, E-85, and Electric as column headers. There are numbers in each cell corresponding to six vehicle types. Fleet mix total is 100.00% " >}}


{{< figure src="Zappa5.png" alt="Grey window that says  "Set Traffic Changes" and "Fleet Mix" with Vehicle type, Gasoline, Diesel, CNG, E-85, and Electric as column headers. All numbers are assigned in electric only now." >}}


**Finally, review changes made to model**
{{< figure src="Zappa6.png" alt="Grey window that says "Emissions changes" and "Hover over the emissions tier to see the full tier names". The column headers are # of ZIP Codes, # of waterways, emission tier, NH3, NO2, PM2.5, SO2, and VOC. There are buttons for: show shapes, delete, and close.." >}}

We can review the emissions and traffic changes made (if any) in the “Review Changes” dropdown menu. Then, name the model, save, and then click run!

**Lastly, review the results of the completed model**
After running the model, the saved and run model will appear in “Model Runs” of your account.

{{< figure src="Zappa7.png" alt="Image of Model run results for: Electric_Power_Generation_All_Zips. The dropdown menu notes the description, displayed metric (total health benefits), ZIP Code result details, citywide totals, and download results.

You can toggle through the estimated impacts of the policy change in the final model. 

{{< figure src="Zappa8.png" alt="Grey drop down menu of Category: Concentrations, Health Impacts, Economic Impacts and Health Impacts is selected." >}}
