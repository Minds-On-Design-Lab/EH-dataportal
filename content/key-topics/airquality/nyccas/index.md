methods: |
    The Health Department designed NYCCAS to understand how average air pollution levels vary from place to place within New York City. NYCCAS staff mount samplers on street light poles 10 to 12 feet off the ground along residential and commercial streets and in parks. The monitors use a small battery-powered pump and filters to collect air samples. Our air samplers are deployed at each NYCCAS site once each season and collect data for a two-week period. Samples are collected in all seasons for NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and BC; in the summer for O<sub>3</sub>; and in the winter for SO<sub>2</sub>. For more details on sample collection methods, see [Appendix 1 (PDF)](Appendix1.pdf).

    The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also has a network of 19 air quality monitors in New York City that are required by the Federal government, but they are mounted on building roofs. We placed our air samplers at street level to measure pollution where people spend time, and where traffic-related pollution levels are usually higher.
    
    NYCCAS has also deployed a limited number of monitors that can measure PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in real time. These monitors allow us to monitor air pollution as it changes based on the time of day, weather or due to local pollution sources, such as heavy-duty trucks.

nyccasSites: |
    The monitoring locations represent a wide variety of New York City environments – sidewalks, busy streets, parks and quiet neighborhood roads. Most of the sites (80%) were chosen by the Health Department to ensure representation in all types of neighborhoods, including residential, commercial and industrial areas. The locations vary in how many trees they have and in the density of traffic and buildings. The remaining sites were selected because they are near potentially high-emission locations that were not captured in the initial assignment. These include Times Square, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. The number of sites has changed over the years as we have learned about air quality in our city. In 2021, we monitored 78 routine locations and an additional 15 sites in low-income neighborhoods that would benefit from additional monitoring to understand potential sources of emissions. We refer to these as Environmental Justice Sites, in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green">green</span> on the map.

pollutantMaps: |
    Since it is impossible to sample the air in every location in New York City, we monitor representative sites to determine how pollution levels vary in relation to traffic, buildings, trees and other neighborhood factors. We use NYCCAS monitoring data along with data on land use, traffic, building emissions and other neighborhood factors around the monitors to build a land-use regression (LUR) model. We
    then use the associations from these models to estimate the seasonal average air pollution levels at locations across the city, including places where no NYCCAS measurements were collected. For more details on emission source data, see [Appendix 1 (PDF)](Appendix1.pdf). For more details on the analysis methods, see []NYCCAS

    In the maps below, you can select a pollutant to see how air pollution is distributed throughout the city and how it has changed over time. The city’s air quality has changed significantly since NYCCAS began monitoring, as can be seen in the maps below. The levels of BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been significantly reduced citywide. The areas where we see the highest levels of these pollutants has also shifted.</p> <p>Over time, there are better data available for us to understand the relationships between land use and pollution, and the air pollution patterns have shifted as the city changes. Although industrial land use has been a primary indicator of BC, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in the past, in the most recent years of data we see evidence that density of warehouses with loading docks better explains the difference in pollution levels between neighborhoods.  Areas with a density of warehouses, such as Newtown Creek area in Queens and Brooklyn, near JFK airport, Sunset Park in Brooklyn and Hunts Point in the Bronx, higher levels of pollution.

    There have been too few sites with SO<sub>2</sub> values above the detection limit for us to include data after winter 2017-2018 in these maps and charts. SO<sub>2</sub> levels have gone down dramatically since  [Local Law 43 of 2010 prohibited the burning of heavy fuel oil (No. 6) in New York City buildings (PDF)](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/air/local-law-43-biodiesel-fuel-requirement.pdf). Historical maps for SO<sub>2</sub> and other pollutants are available by clicking on the “All years” button below.

    Winter and summer average maps for BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> are available in [Appendix 2 (PDF)](Appendix2.pdf).
pollutantTrends: >-
    <p>Since monitoring began in winter 2008-2009 in New York City, we have seen
    a decrease in most of the air pollutants we measure. However, the
    concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> continue to be
    higher in industrial zones with more diesel truck traffic, neighborhoods
    with large numbers of restaurants, and areas of higher traffic and building
    density. </p>

    <p>Air pollution changes not only by neighborhood, but also by season. Some
    pollutants are highest in certain seasons of the year because of either
    weather patterns or emissions sources. For example, O<sub>3</sub> is
    produced when NO and NO<sub>2</sub> and other airborne pollutants react in the
    presence of heat and sunlight. Therefore, we only monitor O<sub>3</sub> in
    the summer when direct sunlight is highest and days are longer.</p><p>The
    figure below illustrates how the levels of each air pollutant change by
    season from winter 2008-2009 to fall 2021. We compare trends among locations
    with high, medium and low densities of the most common sources of each
    pollutant.</p>
pollutantPredictors: >-
    <p>NYCCAS data were analyzed using a land-use regression (LUR) model. LUR models estimate associations among pollution levels, average traffic, building emissions, land use and other neighborhood factors around the monitoring sites. The pollution sources that contribute most to differences in concentrations of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, BC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> across NYC are listed in the table below. SO<sub>2</sub> is now so low in NYC that it is not possible to build a LUR model for the most recent years of data.</p><p>Fuel used to provide heat and hot water in buildings has become significantly cleaner under state and local regulations requiring use of cleaner burning fuels. As a result, commercial charbroiling and grilling operations have become a more important source of PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions over the past several years. The number of commercial cooking charbroilers and grills in an area now explains PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Black Carbon differences among neighborhoods better than building emissions.

conclusion: >-
    <p>This report underscores the importance of emissions reduction efforts
    over the past decade and highlights the continued need to reduce emissions
    citywide. The City’s sustainability plan, PlaNYC, and its roadmap to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions, <a
    href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/sustainability/downloads/pdf/publications/New
    York City's Roadmap to 80 x 50_Final.pdf">80x50</a>, have already and will
    continue to improve air quality, providing important public health benefits
    to all New Yorkers. These strategies and measures
    include:</p><ul><li>Reducing emissions from commercial charbroiling through
    regulations and technical support to restaurants</li><li>Creating low or
    zero emission freight networks and reducing reliance on
    trucks</li><li>Improving and expanding public transit</li><li>Getting the
    most polluting trucks off New York City streets</li><li>Accelerating the
    phase-out of fossil fuel combustion in buildings focusing on the communities
    most impacted by air pollution related health impacts</li></ul><p>Air
    quality in New York City has greatly improved over the past decade and will
    continue to improve with efforts to control emissions from the most
    important sources.  </p>

## NYCCAS Report: 2008-2021

In 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department) established the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. city. NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:

* Help inform PlaNYC, the City’s sustainability plan
* Track changes in air quality over time
* Estimate exposures for health research
* Inform the public about local topics, such as&nbsp;[recent air quality improvements](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/breatheeasy/), [car-free zones](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqts/), [changes in the sources of air pollution](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq-cooking/), [unique air quality studies conducted in New York City](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqsnapshots/), [efforts to reduce health impacts](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/hia/) and [differences in air quality and related health impacts across NYC neighborhoods](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq2/).

This report:

* Provides a summary of key findings, the air monitoring program, monitoring site selection, and descriptions of the pollutants measured
* Describes the trends in air pollutant levels from more than a decade of data from winter 2008-2009 through fall 2021 for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, black carbon, wintertime sulfur dioxide and summertime ozone
* Presents maps of neighborhood air pollution levels by year
* Identifies the local sources that contribute to high levels of these pollutants in New York City neighborhoods

### Key Findings

**Citywide, annual average levels of four key pollutants have gone down between the first year of monitoring, 2009, and the most recent year of data, 2021.**

* Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-40%
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; -38%
* Nitric Oxide (NO)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -58%
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -97%

**Air quality improved significantly after local regulations required building owners to convert to cleaner heating oils by 2015.** These heating oils were a major source of SO<sub>2</sub> in New York City. In 2021, only eight of our 90 sites detected any SO<sub>2</sub>, and the levels at those sites were similar to SO<sub>2</sub> levels measured on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains, demonstrating the success of the clean heating oil requirements.

**Air quality changes with location.**

PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and BC are highest in:

* Areas with higher density of commercial cooking grills and charbroilers
* Industrial areas, specifically areas with higher density of warehouses
* Areas of higher traffic density
* Areas with higher building density

Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels are highest in:

* Areas with lower vehicle emissions
