pollutantMaps: >
    Since it is impossible to sample the air in every location in New York City,
    we monitor representative sites to determine how pollution levels vary in
    relation to traffic, buildings, trees and other neighborhood factors. We use
    NYCCAS monitoring data along with data on land use, traffic, building
    emissions and other neighborhood factors around the monitors to build a
    land-use regression (LUR) model. We

    then use the associations from these models to estimate the seasonal average
    air pollution levels at locations across the city, including places where no
    NYCCAS measurements were collected. For more details on emission source
    data, see [Appendix 1 (PDF)](Appendix1.pdf). For more details on the
    analysis methods, see [NYCCAS

    Scientific
    Publications](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/air-quality-nyc-community-air-survey.page#nyccas-pubs).


    In the maps below, you can select a pollutant to see how air pollution is
    distributed throughout the city and how it has changed over time. The city’s
    air quality has changed significantly since NYCCAS began monitoring, as can
    be seen in the maps below. The levels of BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO,
    SO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been significantly reduced
    citywide. The areas where we see the highest levels of these pollutants has
    also shifted.</p> <p>Over time, there are better data available for us to
    understand the relationships between land use and pollution, and the air
    pollution patterns have shifted as the city changes. Although industrial
    land use has been a primary indicator of BC, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution in the past, in the most recent years of data we
    see evidence that density of warehouses with loading docks better explains
    the difference in pollution levels between neighborhoods.  Areas with a
    density of warehouses, such as Newtown Creek area in Queens and Brooklyn,
    near JFK airport, Sunset Park in Brooklyn and Hunts Point in the Bronx,
    higher levels of pollution.


    There have been too few sites with SO<sub>2</sub> values above the detection
    limit for us to include data after winter 2017-2018 in these maps and
    charts. SO<sub>2</sub> levels have gone down dramatically since  [Local Law
    43 of 2010 prohibited the burning of heavy fuel oil (No. 6) in New York City
    buildings
    (PDF)](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/air/local-law-43-biodiesel-fuel-requirement.pdf).
    Historical maps for SO<sub>2</sub> and other pollutants are available by
    clicking on the “All years” button below.


    Winter and summer average maps for BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> are available in [Appendix 2 (PDF)](Appendix2.pdf).
pollutantTrends: >
    Since monitoring began in winter 2008-2009 in New York City, we have seen a
    decrease in most of the air pollutants we measure. However, the
    concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> continue to be
    higher in industrial zones with more diesel truck traffic, neighborhoods
    with large numbers of restaurants, and areas of higher traffic and building
    density.


    Air pollution changes not only by neighborhood, but also by season. Some
    pollutants are highest in certain seasons of the year because of either
    weather patterns or emissions sources. For example, O<sub>3</sub> is
    produced when NO and NO<sub>2</sub> and other airborne pollutants react in
    the presence of heat and sunlight. Therefore, we only monitor O<sub>3</sub>
    in the summer when direct sunlight is highest and days are longer.


    The figure below illustrates how the levels of each air pollutant change by
    season from winter 2008-2009 to fall 2021. We compare trends among locations
    with high, medium and low densities of the most common sources of each
    pollutant.
conclusion: >
    This report underscores the importance of emissions reduction efforts over
    the past decade and highlights the continued need to reduce emissions
    citywide. The City’s sustainability plan, PlaNYC, and its [roadmap to reduce

    greenhouse gas emissions,
    80x50](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/sustainability/downloads/pdf/publications/New%20York%20City's%20Roadmap%20to%2080%20x%2050_Final.pdf),
    have already and will continue to improve air quality, providing important
    public health benefits to all New Yorkers. These strategies and measures
    include:
        - Reducing emissions from commercial charbroiling through regulations and technical support to restaurants
        - Creating low or zero emission freight networks and reducing reliance on
    trucks
        - Improving and expanding public transit
        - Getting the most polluting trucks off New York City streets
        - Accelerating the phase-out of fossil fuel combustion in buildings focusing on the communities
    most impacted by air pollution related health impacts


    Air quality in New York City has greatly improved over the past decade and
    will continue to improve with efforts to control emissions from the most
    important sources.

        name: Fine Particles
        copy: >
            Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) are tiny airborne solid and liquid
            particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter. PM<sub>2.5</sub> is the
            most harmful urban air pollutant. It is small enough to penetrate
            deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, which can worsen lung
            and heart disease and lead to hospital admissions and premature
            deaths. PM<sub>2.5</sub> can either be directly emitted or formed in
            the atmosphere from other pollutants. Fuel combustion in vehicles,
            boilers in buildings, power plants, construction equipment, marine
            vessels and commercial cooking are all common sources of
            PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Between 20% and 30% of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> in New
            York City's air comes from sources in areas upwind from the city,
            such as coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.

    -
        name: Black Carbon
        copy: >
            Black carbon (BC) is one type of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and is the sooty
            black material emitted from gas and diesel engines, coal-fired power
            plants and other sources that burn fossil fuels. It comprises up to
            20% of fine particulate matter in New York City. Unlike other fine
            particles, BC is primarily from local sources. Inhalation of BC is
            associated with health problems, including respiratory and
            cardiovascular disease, cancer and birth defects. BC also
            contributes to climate change by altering the patterns of rain and
            clouds.

        name: Nitrogen Dioxide and Nitric Oxide
        copy: >
            Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) are part of
            a group of pollutants called "oxides of nitrogen" (NO<sub>X</sub>).
            Exposures to NO<sub>X</sub> are linked to increased emergency
            department visits and hospitalizations for respiratory conditions,
            particularly asthma. NO<sub>X</sub> also reacts with other compounds
            in the atmosphere to form PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone. A variety of
            combustion sources produce NO<sub>X</sub> in New York City,
            including motor vehicles, buildings, marine vessels and construction
            equipment.
        number: 3
    -
        name: Ozone
        copy: >
            Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) forms at ground level when NO<sub>X</sub>
            emissions combine with sunlight and other airborne pollutants.
            Measured O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are often highest in the
            summer and downwind from areas with high NO<sub>X</sub> emissions,
            such as places with high traffic density. In areas with heavy
            traffic, NO<sub>X</sub> reacts with any ground-level O<sub>3</sub>
            to reduce O<sub>3</sub> concentrations. As a result, NYCCAS has
            measured lower O<sub>3</sub> levels near roadways, in city centers
            and in other areas of high NO<sub>X</sub> emissions density. Higher
            levels of O<sub>3</sub> are seen in areas away from dense traffic
            and building emissions.
        number: 4
    -
        name: Sulfur Dioxide
        copy: >
            Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is produced mainly by burning oils
            with high sulfur content, such as No. 4 and No. 6 oil (also known as
            residual fuel oil), or high-sulfur No. 2 oil. The primary use of
            fuel oil in NYC is to heat buildings and water, which is why we only
            monitor it in the winter. Some high-sulfur oil is also used to
            generate electricity and power marine vessels. SO<sub>2</sub>
            exposures can worsen lung diseases, causing hospitalizations and
            emergency department visits for asthma and other respiratory
            conditions. SO<sub>2</sub> also contributes to the formation of
            PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the atmosphere, resulting in PM<sub>2.5</sub>
            exposures downwind of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        number: 5
methods: >
    The Health Department designed NYCCAS to understand how average air
    pollution levels vary from place to place within New York City. NYCCAS staff
    mount samplers on street light poles 10 to 12 feet off the ground along
    residential and commercial streets and in parks. The monitors use a small
    battery-powered pump and filters to collect air samples. Our air samplers
    are deployed at each NYCCAS site once each season and collect data for a
    two-week period. Samples are collected in all seasons for NO,
    NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and BC; in the summer for O<sub>3</sub>;
    and in the winter for SO<sub>2</sub>. For more details on sample collection
    methods, see [Appendix 1 (PDF)](Appendix1.pdf).


    The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also has a
    network of 19 air quality monitors in New York City that are required by the
    Federal government, but they are mounted on building roofs. We placed our
    air samplers at street level to measure pollution where people spend time,
    and where traffic-related pollution levels are usually higher.


    NYCCAS has also deployed a limited number of monitors that can measure
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in real time. These monitors allow us to monitor air
    pollution as it changes based on the time of day, weather or due to local
    pollution sources, such as heavy-duty trucks. [Get data on real-time air
    quality](../realtime/).
nyccasSites: >
    The monitoring locations represent a wide variety of New York City
    environments – sidewalks, busy streets, parks and quiet neighborhood roads.
    Most of the sites (80%) were chosen by the Health Department to ensure
    representation in all types of neighborhoods, including residential,
    commercial and industrial areas. The locations vary in how many trees they
    have and in the density of traffic and buildings. The remaining sites were
    selected because they are near potentially high-emission locations that were
    not captured in the initial assignment. These include Times Square, the Port
    Authority Bus Terminal and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. The number of
    sites has changed over the years as we have learned about air quality in our
    city. In 2021, we monitored 78 routine locations and an additional 15 sites
    in low-income neighborhoods that would benefit from additional monitoring to
    understand potential sources of emissions. We refer to these as
    Environmental Justice Sites, in <span style="font-weight:bold;
    color:green">green</span> on the map. [More about monitoring at
    Environmental Justice Sites](../../../data-stories/AQsnapshots/).
mapTextBC: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of Black Carbon declined by 45% between 2009
    and 2021, an average of 0.05 micrograms per cubic meter per year. 


    Across the 13-year period, higher levels were consistently seen near
    warehouses within industrial areas (reflecting increased truck traffic
    density) and in areas with higher nearby commercial cooking
    grills/charbroilers. 


    In 2021, seasonal average BC concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 0.23 to 1.9 micrograms per cubic meter.
mapTextNO: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of Nitric Oxide declined by 58% between 2009
    and 2021, an average of 1.7 parts per billion per year.


    Across the 13-year period, higher levels were consistently seen at sites
    with higher nearby building density, emissions from overall traffic and from
    truck traffic related to warehouses.


    In 2021, seasonal average NO concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 2.6 to 59.9 ppb.
mapTextNO2: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of Nitrogen Dioxide declined by 38% between
    2009 and 2021, an average of 0.86 parts per billion per year.


    Across the 13-year period, higher levels were consistently seen at sites
    with higher nearby building and traffic emissions. The persistence of
    building density as the most important indicator of NO2 reflects the
    continued use of fossil fuel combustion for heat and hot water, even as
    fuels become cleaner and equipment more efficient.


    In 2021, seasonal average NO2 concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 3.7 to 37.1 ppb.    
mapTextPM: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of fine particulate matter declined by 40%
    between 2009 and 2021, an average of 0.4 micrograms per cubic meter per
    year.


    Recently, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been seen at sites with
    nearby commercial cooking grills/charbroilers and traffic emissions. This is
    largely due to buildings using cleaner fuels for heating and therefore
    emitting less PM<sub>2.5</sub> than when NYCCAS began monitoring.


    In 2021, seasonal average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across NYCCAS
    monitoring sites ranged from 2.4 to 15.1 micrograms per cubic meter.
mapTextO3: >
    Since the first summer (2009) when relatively cool temperatures contributed
    to lower levels of Ozone, citywide summertime average levels varied slightly
    year to year (ranging from 27.8 ppb to 31.4 ppb between 2010 and 2021),
    without a consistent trend.


    Higher levels were consistently measured at sites with lower traffic density
    and lower NO2 concentrations such as areas of outer Queens, Brooklyn, and
    Staten Island, reflecting less removal of ozone from the atmosphere by fresh
    combustion NOX emissions.


    In summer 2021, seasonal average O3 varied from 24.3 to 38 ppb across the
    monitoring sites.
pollutantPredictors: >
    NYCCAS data were analyzed using a land-use regression (LUR) model. LUR
    models estimate associations among pollution levels, average traffic,
    building emissions, land use and other neighborhood factors around the
    monitoring sites. The pollution sources that contribute most to differences
    in concentrations of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, BC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> across NYC
    are listed in the table below. SO<sub>2</sub> is now so low in NYC that it
    is not possible to build a LUR model for the most recent years of data.


    Fuel used to provide heat and hot water in buildings has become
    significantly cleaner under state and local regulations requiring use of
    cleaner burning fuels. As a result, commercial charbroiling and grilling
    operations have become a more important source of PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions
    over the past several years. The number of commercial cooking charbroilers
    and grills in an area now explains PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Black Carbon
    differences among neighborhoods better than building emissions. For more
    information on these changes, see [Tracking changes in New York City's
    sources of air pollution](../../data-stories/aq-cooking).

## NYCCAS Report: 2008-2021

In 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department) established the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. city. NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:

* Help inform PlaNYC, the City’s sustainability plan
* Track changes in air quality over time
* Estimate exposures for health research
* Inform the public about local topics, such as&nbsp;[recent air quality improvements](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/breatheeasy/), [car-free zones](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqts/), [changes in the sources of air pollution](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq-cooking/), [unique air quality studies conducted in New York City](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqsnapshots/), [efforts to reduce health impacts](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/hia/) and [differences in air quality and related health impacts across NYC neighborhoods](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq2/).

This report:

* Provides a summary of key findings, the air monitoring program, monitoring site selection, and descriptions of the pollutants measured
* Describes the trends in air pollutant levels from more than a decade of data from winter 2008-2009 through fall 2021 for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, black carbon, wintertime sulfur dioxide and summertime ozone
* Presents maps of neighborhood air pollution levels by year
* Identifies the local sources that contribute to high levels of these pollutants in New York City neighborhoods

### Key Findings

**Citywide, annual average levels of four key pollutants have gone down between the first year of monitoring, 2009, and the most recent year of data, 2021.**

* Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-40%
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; -38%
* Nitric Oxide (NO)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -58%
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -97%

**Air quality improved significantly after local regulations required building owners to convert to cleaner heating oils by 2015.** These heating oils were a major source of SO<sub>2</sub> in New York City. In 2021, only eight of our 90 sites detected any SO<sub>2</sub>, and the levels at those sites were similar to SO<sub>2</sub> levels measured on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains, demonstrating the success of the clean heating oil requirements.

**Air quality changes with location.**

PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and BC are highest in:

* Areas with higher density of commercial cooking grills and charbroilers
* Industrial areas, specifically areas with higher density of warehouses
* Areas of higher traffic density
* Areas with higher building density

Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels are highest in:

* Areas with lower vehicle emissions
