pollutantMaps: >-
    <p>Since it is impossible to sample the air in every location in New York
    City, we monitor representative sites to determine how pollution levels vary
    in relation to traffic, buildings, trees and other neighborhood factors. We
    use NYCCAS monitoring data along with data on land use, traffic, building
    emissions and other neighborhood factors around the monitors to build a
    land-use regression (LUR) model. We then used the associations from these
    models to estimate the seasonal average air pollution levels at locations
    across the city, including places where no NYCCAS measurements were
    collected. For more details on emission source data, see <a
    href="https://nyccas.cityofnewyork.us/nyccas2021v9/sites/default/files/NYCCAS-appendix/Appendix1.pdf">Appendix
    1 (PDF)</a>. For more details on the analysis methods, see <a
    href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/air-quality-nyc-community-air-survey.page#nyccas-pubs">NYCCAS
    Scientific Publications</a>.</p> <p>In the maps below, you can select a
    pollutant to see how air pollution is distributed throughout the city and
    how it has changed over time. The City’s air quality has changed
    significantly since NYCCAS began monitoring, as can be seen in the maps
    below. The levels of BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, SO<sub>2</sub> and
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been significantly reduced citywide. The areas where
    we see the highest levels of these pollutants has also shifted.</p> <p>Over
    time, the data we use to model the relationships between land use and
    pollution has gotten better and the pattern of air pollution changes may
    shift. For example, in previous years industrial land use was used as a
    primary indicator of BC, NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and
    PM<sub>2.5&nbsp;</sub>pollution, but we have noticed in recent years this
    pollution has become more closely related to the presence of distribution
    centers within these industrial areas. Therefore, more distinct pollution
    hotspots are shown in recent years near distribution centers in the Newtown
    Creek area in Queens and Brooklyn, JFK airport and Hunts Point in the
    Bronx.</p> <p>Winter and summer average maps for BC, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> are available in <a
    href="https://nyccas.cityofnewyork.us/nyccas2022/sites/default/files/NYCCAS-appendix/Appendix2.pdf">Appendix
    2 (PDF)</a>.</p>
pollutantTrends: >-
    <p>Since monitoring began in winter 2008-2009 in New York City, we have seen
    a decrease in most of the air pollutants we measure. However, the
    concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO and PM<sub>2.5</sub> continue to be
    higher in industrial zones with more diesel truck traffic, neighborhoods
    with large numbers of restaurants, and areas of higher traffic and building
    density. Air pollution changes not only by neighborhood, but also by season.
    Some pollutants are highest in certain seasons of the year because of either
    weather patterns or emissions sources. For example, O<sub>3</sub> is
    produced when NO<sub>X</sub>&nbsp;and other airborne pollutants react in the
    presence of heat and sunlight. Therefore, we only monitor O<sub>3</sub> in
    the summer when direct sunlight is highest and days are longer.</p><p>The
    figure below illustrates how the levels of each air pollutant change by
    season from winter 2008-2009 to fall 2021. We break out locations with high,
    medium and low densities of the most common sources of each. Since winter
    2017-18 there have been too few sites with SO<sub>2</sub> values above the
    detection limit for us to include it in this chart. SO<sub>2</sub> levels
    have gone down dramatically since <a

    Law 43 of 2010 prohibited the burning of heavy fuel oil (No. 6) in New York
    City buildings</a>.
conclusion: >-
    <p>This report underscores the importance of emissions reduction efforts
    over the past decade and highlights the continued need to reduce emissions
    citywide. The City’s sustainability plan, OneNYC, and its roadmap to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions, 80x50, have already and will continue to improve
    air quality, providing important public health benefits to all New Yorkers.
    These strategies and measures include:</p><ul><li>Transitioning the
    City&apos;s fleet to more efficient, less polluting heavy-duty vehicles,
    such as trash trucks and school buses</li><li>Reducing motor vehicle use by
    shifting to more sustainable modes of transportation</li><li>Creating more
    efficient freight networks and expanding truck retrofit and replacement
    programs</li><li>Continuing to reduce fossil fuel combustion in
    buildings</li></ul><p>Additionally, reducing emissions from other widely
    distributed sources of pollution, such as BC and PM<sub>2.5</sub> from
    commercial charbroiling, will contribute to improved air quality in the
    future.</p>

## NYCCAS Report: 2008-2021

In 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Health Department) established the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), the largest ongoing urban air monitoring program of any U.S. City. NYCCAS, which began collecting data in December 2008, is a collaboration between the Health Department and Queens College of the City University of New York and provides data to:

* Help inform OneNYC, the City’s sustainability plan
* Track changes in air quality over time
* Estimate exposures for health research
* Inform the public about local topics, such as: [tools we use to measure health impacts from air quality policy changes](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/zappa/), [air quality in the time of COVID-19](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqcovid2/), [recent air quality improvements](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/breatheeasy/), [car-free zones](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqts/), [changes in the sources of air pollution](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq-cooking/), [unique studies conducted in New York City](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aqsnapshots/), [efforts to reduce health impacts](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/hia/) and [differences in air quality and health impacts across NYC neighborhoods](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-stories/aq2/).

This report:

* Provides a summary of key findings, the air monitoring program, monitoring site selection, and descriptions of the pollutants measured
* Describes the trends in air pollutant levels from more than a decade of data between winter 2008-2009 through fall 2021 for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, black carbon, wintertime sulfur dioxide and summertime ozone
* Presents maps of neighborhood air pollution levels by year
* Identifies the local sources that contribute to high levels of these pollutants in New York City neighborhoods

### Key Findings

**Citywide, annual average levels of four key pollutants have gone down between the first year of monitoring, 2009, and the most recent year of data, 2021.**

* Fine particles (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-40%
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; -38%
* Nitric Oxide (NO)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -58%
* Sulfer Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -97%

**Air quality improved significantly after the local regulations required building owners to convert to cleaner heating oils by 2015.** These heating oils were a major source of SO<sub>2</sub> in New York City. In 2021, only eight of our 90 sites detected any SO<sub>2</sub>, and the levels at those sites were similar to SO<sub>2</sub> levels measured on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains, demonstrating the success of the clean heating oil requirements.

**Air quality changes with location.** PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and BC are highest in:

* Areas with higher density of commercial cooking grills and charbroilers
* Industrial areas
* Areas of higher traffic density
* Areas with higher building density

Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) levels are highest in:

* The outer boroughs
* Areas that are downwind of high NO<sub>X</sub> (oxides of nitrogen) emissions
* Areas with fewer combustion emissions
