The monitoring locations represent a wide variety of New York City environments â€“ sidewalks, busy streets, parks and quiet neighborhood roads. Most of the sites (80%) were chosen by the Health Department to ensure representation in all types of neighborhoods, including residential, commercial and industrial areas. The locations vary in how many trees they have and in the density of traffic and buildings. The remaining sites were selected because they are near potentially high-emission locations that were not captured initially. These include the Hunts Point Market, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. The number of sites has changed over the years as we have learned about air quality in our city.

In 2022, we monitored 78 routine locations and an additional 15 sites in low-income neighborhoods that would benefit from additional monitoring to understand potential sources of emissions. We refer to these 15 sites as Environmental Justice Sites, in green on the map. [More about monitoring at Environmental Justice Sites](../../../data-stories/AQsnapshots/).
