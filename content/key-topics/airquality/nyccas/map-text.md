BC: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of Black Carbon declined by 45% between 2009
    and 2021, an average of 0.05 micrograms per cubic meter per year. 

    Across the 13-year period, higher levels were consistently seen near
    warehouses within industrial areas (reflecting increased truck traffic
    density) and in areas with higher nearby commercial cooking
    grills/charbroilers. 

    In 2021, seasonal average BC concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 0.23 to 1.9 micrograms per cubic meter.
NO: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of Nitric Oxide declined by 58% between 2009
    and 2021, an average of 1.7 parts per billion per year.

    Across the 13-year period, higher levels were consistently seen at sites
    with higher nearby building density, emissions from overall traffic and from
    truck traffic related to warehouses.

    In 2021, seasonal average NO concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 2.6 to 59.9 ppb.
NO2: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of Nitrogen Dioxide declined by 38% between
    2009 and 2021, an average of 0.86 parts per billion per year.

    Across the 13-year period, higher levels were consistently seen at sites
    with higher nearby building and traffic emissions. The persistence of
    building density as the most important indicator of NO2 reflects the
    continued use of fossil fuel combustion for heat and hot water, even as
    fuels become cleaner and equipment more efficient.

    In 2021, seasonal average NO2 concentrations across NYCCAS monitoring sites
    ranged from 3.7 to 37.1 ppb.    
PM: >
    Citywide, annual average levels of fine particulate matter declined by 40%
    between 2009 and 2021, an average of 0.4 micrograms per cubic meter per
    year.

    Recently, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> have been seen at sites with
    nearby commercial cooking grills/charbroilers and traffic emissions. This is
    largely due to buildings using cleaner fuels for heating and therefore
    emitting less PM<sub>2.5</sub> than when NYCCAS began monitoring.


    In 2021, seasonal average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across NYCCAS
    monitoring sites ranged from 2.4 to 15.1 micrograms per cubic meter.
O3: >
    Since the first summer (2009) when relatively cool temperatures contributed
    to lower levels of Ozone, citywide summertime average levels varied slightly
    year to year (ranging from 27.8 ppb to 31.4 ppb between 2010 and 2021),
    without a consistent trend.

    Higher levels were consistently measured at sites with lower traffic density
    and lower NO2 concentrations such as areas of outer Queens, Brooklyn, and
    Staten Island, reflecting less removal of ozone from the atmosphere by fresh
    combustion NOX emissions.

    In summer 2021, seasonal average O3 varied from 24.3 to 38 ppb across the
    monitoring sites.
