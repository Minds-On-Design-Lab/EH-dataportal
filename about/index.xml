      <description>The NYC Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal shows how environments affect health, by publishing data and information that explain the connection. Public health professionals, community-based organizations, community boards, city agencies, elected officials, health workers, advocates, and everyday New Yorkers use this website to get important information that they need to do their jobs and make important, informed decisions about health.
The Environment &amp;amp; Health Data Portal is a project by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Environmental Surveillance and Policy.</description>
