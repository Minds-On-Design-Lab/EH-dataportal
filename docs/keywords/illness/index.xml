      <description>Health Impacts of Air Pollution About Estimated Health Impacts of Air Pollution Air pollution is an important environmental threat to the health of New York City residents. Exposures to two common air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), can worsen respiratory illness and heart conditions and contribute to premature deaths. Older adults, children and people with existing heart and lung disease are especially affected. This site provides estimates of the impact of air pollution on the health of NYC residents as measured by the numbers of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths attributable to PM2.</description>

      <description>Large City Air Quality Comparison Air Quality OneNYC is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City&amp;rsquo;s future.
Goal: Achieve the cleanest air quality of any big United States (US) city.
To measure progress towards this goal, we are tracking atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in NYC compared to other large cities (populations greater than 1 million) in the US.
Air Quality and Sustainability Particulate matter is a complex mixture of very small solids and droplets suspended in air.</description>

      <description>Neighborhood Air Quality About Neighborhood Air Quality Air quality can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. That is why the **New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS)**keeps track of street-level air pollution from about 100 locations throughout New York City every season. NYCCAS is part of OneNYC, New York City&amp;rsquo;s long-term plan for sustainability.
The pollutants we measure are: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone (O3, summer), nitrogen oxides (NOx), black carbon from diesel exhaust, sulfur dioxide (SO2, winter) and nickel (Ni, winter).</description>
