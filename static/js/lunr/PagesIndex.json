but in unusual cases the welt may persist for several weeks An antiitching ointment can help but if bites become infected people should see their doctor The anxiety about being bitten can lead to sleeplessness which can affect wellbeing Properly and effectively responding to bed bugs helps to keep anxiety in check Some people become so desperate that they use illegal or excessive amounts of pesticides which can lead to poisonings About the Data and Indicators Estimates of numbers and percentages of adults reporting bed bugs in their homes are measured using survey data The accuracy of the survey data depends on the participants ability to recall and correctly report the presence of bed bugs Prevention and Control In New York City building owners are required by law to provide apartments free of pests but residents can also take steps to prevent the spread of bed bugs Never bring bed frames mattresses box springs or upholstered furniture found on the street into your home and check all used or rented furniture for bed bugs When traveling inspect the bed and furniture Keep suitcases off the floor and bed and inspect them before you leave If you suspect you have been around bed bugs immediately wash and dry your clothing on hot settings or store items in a sealed plastic bag until you can Seal cracks and crevices with caulk even if you dont have bed bugs This will

Registryhttpwwwhealthstatenyusdiseasescongenitalmalformationscmrhomehtm Birth Defects and the Environment Scientists believe most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors including our genes behaviors and environment However the causes of most birth defects are unknown The fetus is more sensitive to exposures than an adult and if exposures happen during important periods of development birth defects may result Although there has been some research into how environmental exposures might cause birth defects there is still much more work that needs to be done to understand the relationship of these exposures to birth defects Known and probable risk factors for birth defects include the following smoking use of alcohol and other drugs poor nutrition andor health such as low levels of folic acid obesity and poorly controlled diabetes some medicines prescription overthecounter toxic chemicals such as lead paint and paint thinner gasoline pesticides and secondhand smoke infectious agents such as rubella and toxoplasmosis and ionizing radiation xrays About the Data and Indicators Collecting and sharing good data about the occurrence of birth defects is a first step in understanding how they might be related to the environment Looking at patterns of birth defect rates can help health officials plan services and create ideas for research into environmental causes of birth defects All birth defects in any child less than two years old are reportable under New York State law to the State Congenital Malformations Registry Most birth defect reports are abstracted from inpatient hospital records since birth defects diagnosed on an outpatient basis are not well reported Accurate hospital clinical recognition of birth defects depends on clinical expertise and interest This is particularly true of conditions more difficult to diagnose As a result identification of birth defects may vary by area and by time Areas with hospitals that provide higher levels of

recorded on the babys birth certificate We use the physicians clinical estimate of gestation to identify preterm births We use very low birth weight 3 lbs 5 oz as an indicator of preterm birth because most very low birth weight babies are born preterm We use low birth weight 5 lbs 8 oz among pregnancies that reach term at least 37 weeks as an indicator of growth retardation Restricting to term pregnancies removes the majority of low birth weight babies who are small because they were born preterm and did not have time to finish growing before birth Historically the ratio of male to female births has been about 105 Some have hypothesized that exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can reduce the number of male births so sex ratio may be a useful environmental public health

exist and the number that have been successfully cleaned up through an official city state or federal program Brownfields in New York City The NYC Office of Environmental Remediation OER was created to help identify brownfields and assist with their cleanup As part of its efforts OER has developed a Vacant Property Database VPD to help developers identify vacant commercial and industrial properties that may be available for redevelopment and to provide basic data on past property usage and environmental features As of 2011 NYC had between 1500 and 2000 potential brownfields based on a review of vacant properties historic filling patterns and other environmental features in the VPD The VPD assesses potential or actual contamination on vacant properties which are only a fraction of the total property stock in NYC Thus new brownfield sites will continue to emerge as buildings reach the end of their use cycle and are rebuilt Our target is to ultimately reduce the number of brownfields in NYC to zero Brownfield Site Remediation The PlaNYC goal is to provide the necessary resources to enable brownfields to be redeveloped as easily or more easily than equivalent

radiation Genetic abnormalities and conditions including Down Syndrome Exposure to chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents About the Data and Indicators Data are reported over fiveyear periods because the number of cases and rates for single years can vary considerably particularly for less common types of cancer Counts and rates are calculated based upon residential address at time of

years Data on lead paint hazards the most common source of lead exposure for children can be found under the topic Built Environment on this portal Additional lead data are available through publications and annual reports to City Councilhttpswww1nycgovsitedohdatadatasetsleadpubspage Open the Lead health publications page in a new tab Prevention To prevent exposure to lead hazards you can do the following Call 311 if your landlord does not fix peeling paint or if you think repair work is being done unsafely Call 311 if you live in a one or twofamily house with peeling paint and have a child under six years old Ask for the Health Departments Healthy Homes Program HHP Wash floors window sills hands toys and pacifiers often Do not use imported foods spices clay pots and dishesmedicines toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two Health care providers should also test other children found to be at risk and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk Key Messages Childhood lead poisoning in NYC has declined dramatically over the last decade The main source of childhood lead poisoning in the United States is leadbased paint in older deteriorated housing Chipping flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home Children can be exposed by eating leadbased paint chips chewing on objects painted with leadbased paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead Information on other sources of lead poisoning can be found herehttpwww1nycgovsitedohhealthhealthtopicsleadpoisoningpreventionpage"},{"title":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary

decade By the 2020s a projected 2530 days above 90F are expected in a typical summer resulting in more frequent and intense heat waves Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase by up to 5 together with another 10 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NYC Panel on Climate Change Climate Risk Information 2009 Climate and Health Even without long term changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the usual rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While less common coastal storms also have imparted serious consequences throughout history and in recent years most notably Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 from their devastating direct costs in over 1800 lives along the Gulf Coast to longterm mental health consequences among survivors In 2011 Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive flooding throughout the Northeast and is estimated to be one of the costliest disasters in US history though New York City was largely spared The health impacts of weather events and climate change may be further compounded by power outages arising during heat waves and coastal storms Such effects include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage acute carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure lack of air conditioning inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs due to elevator outages About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults 65 years and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or other cognitive impairment Some medications can increase heat risk talk to your doctor or pharmacist to learn more about

Current research is investigating whether there are health effects from chronic exposure to the byproducts of water disinfection Nitrates are nitrogenoxygen molecules commonly found in water where nitrogenbased fertilizers are used nearby Decades ago it was discovered that infants who were fed formula made with water containing nitrates over 10 mgL sometimes became seriously ill due to the

not a normal part of aging and research shows that many falls can be prevented Falls and the environment Although falls can occur anywhere falls among older adults frequently happen at home More than onehalf of fallrelated hospitalizations among older adults were due to falls in the home There are many risk factors for falls among older adults including previous falls gait or balance problems and use of multiple medications that interact with one another or cause side effects Physical features of the environment can also put seniors at risk Common fall risks hazards in homes include slippery

is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York Citys future Goal Create homes for nearly a million more New Yorkers while making housing and neighborhoods more affordable and sustainable Housing Supply We are tracking the number of new housing units created since the start of the plan in 2007 as well as the size of the total housing stock to ensure that the city is meeting the supply portion of its goal The nearly one million New Yorkers projected to be added to the citys population between 2005 and 2030 will require 314000 new units of housing To track the creation of new units we look at housing completion data ie the number of newly issued Certificates of Occupancy including Temporary Certificates of Occupancy These indicate that a new residential unit is ready for occupancy Certificates of Occupancy document new units added through new construction but they do not account for demolition of existing units units created or lost through changes of use eg loft conversions or subdivisions or mergers of existing units Thus it is an incomplete measure of net additions to total housing supply To get a greater sense of how supply is changing we also track the number of existing units of housing stock in NYC from the triennial Housing and Vacancy Survey HVS Housing Affordability We are tracking housing affordability by looking at two indicators 1 the number of new units of housing affordable to the typical NYC household and 2 the vacancy rate of apartments across different rental rates To calculate the first indicator we look at the total number of housing units for rent and then what percentage of those units would be affordable to a household earning the median income in that year For example in 2008 the median income of a household in NYC was 45000 according to the HVS which translates to affordable monthly housing costs of no more than 1125 30 of the monthly gross income for that household This indicator tells us about the changing cost of housing and how changes in income relate to the changing cost of housing If housing was becoming more affordable in NYC we would expect the amount of housing available to a typical New Yorker to increase To calculate the second indicator we look at the net rental vacancy rates across different price categories In general the vacancy rate tells us about the relationship between supply and demand Vacancy rates below 5 indicate a housing emergency very low supply andor very high demand Typically vacancy rates in NYC are higher for luxury and more expensive apartments while they are lower for less expensive apartments indicating a relative shortage of adequate inexpensive housing options PlaNYC seeks to increase the availability of inexpensive housing which would be indicated by a higher vacancy rate for lower rent market segments Housing Sustainability We are looking at both access to transit for work and nonwork trips as well as energy usage to track whether NYC is meeting the sustainability portion of our housing goals For the transit criteria we look at the percentage of new building permits issued for residential units that are located within a 12 mile of a transit node eg subway stop commuter rail station Access to transit options will enable future New Yorkers to live more sustainably At the inception of PlaNYC 69 of building permits issued for residential units in the city were within a mile of transit and our aim is to increase this amount Reaching this goal is facilitated by the NYC zoning strategy which upzones areas close to transit to allow additional density Meanwhile areas far from transit are downzoned which has the simultaneous impact of preserving the character of those neighborhoods The number of permits issued should not however be equated with housing completion data We measure the energy used per capita by NYC residential buildings to track the energy intensity of our housing stock from year to year We expect residential energy usage and per capita GHG emissions to fall as the effects of the Greener Greater Buildings Bill passed December 2009 and other actions take effect"},{"title":"Housing","tags":null,"categories":["housing","social","neighborhoods"],"keywords":["built environments","neighborhoods","social","housing","maintenance","maintenance

on lead paint hazards because these are the most common sources of lead poisoning for NYC children Data on children exposed to lead can be found under the topic Health Outcomes and Human Exposures on this portal Indicators are based on data from the Housing and Vacancy Surveyhttpwwwcensusgovhousingnychvs and the US Census 2000 These data provide estimates not exact counts of housing by year of construction and peeling paint status Prevention To prevent exposure to lead landlords tenants and parents can do the following In NYC Local Law 1httpwww1nycgovsitehpdownersLeadBasedPaintpage requires landlords to inspect and fix lead paint hazards at no cost to tenants The law applies to apartments if the following three conditions are met 1 the building was built before 1960 or between 1960 and 1978 if the owner knows the building has lead paint 2 the building has three or more apartments and 3 a child under six years old lives in the apartment If you are a tenant and live in a building covered by Local Law 1 fill out and return the Annual Notice from your landlord asking if a child under six years old lives with you If you dont get the Annual Notice call 311 If you have a new baby or a child under six years old comes to live with you tell your landlord in writing Call 311 if your landlord does not fix peeling paint or if you think repair work is being done unsafely Call 311 if you live in a one or twofamily house with peeling paint and have a child under the age of six Ask for the Health Departments Lead Poisoning Prevention Program Wash floors window sills hands toys and pacifiers often Do not use imported foods spices clay pots and dishes medicines toys and cosmetics that have been found to contain lead All children should be tested for lead poisoning at ages one and two Health care providers should also test other children who may be at risk and annually assess children from six months to six years of age for lead exposure risk Key Messages The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC as in most of the United States is leadbased paint in older deteriorated housing Chipping flaking and peeling paint and paint disturbed during home remodeling contributes to lead dust and contaminates bare soil around a home Children can be exposed by eating leadbased paint chips chewing on objects painted with leadbased paint or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead Lead from sources other than paint may also present a hazard to children Other sources of lead poisoning include Imported herbal medicines and remedies eg azarcon and greta used for upset stomach and litargirio used for several purposes Painted and glazed clay pots and dishes used for cooking serving or storing food Imported cosmetics eg kohl surma kajal Imported candies eg candies made with chili powder candies wrapped in leadcontaminated paper candies stored in clay pots Imported toys and jewelry Work involving the use of lead recycling or making automobile batteries radiator repair Hobbies involving the use of lead making stainedglass windows hunting fishing target shooting"},{"title":"Mice and

are common but preventable In NYC rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks and in backyards and basements while mice are almost always found inside homes Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings This information is collected by the US Census Bureau through the NYC Housing and Vacancy Surveyhttpwwwcensusgovhousingnychvs and by the NYC Health Department through Community Health Surveyshttpwww1nycgovsitedohdatadatasetscommunityhealthsurveypage Mice Rats and Health The presence of rats in communities has been historically associated with a variety of infectious diseases Today rats are principally recognized for their contribution to neighborhood stress poor quality of life contamination of food and for their contribution to the destruction of infrastructure Mice can contaminate food and their urine and dander are potent allergens which can exacerbate the symptoms of asthma in sensitive people About the Data and Indicators Data on mice and rats come from the Housing and Vacancy Survey HVS and the Community Health Survey CHS Because these are sample surveys all data derived from them are estimates not exact counts The accuracy of survey data depends on the participants ability to recall and correctly report mice or rat sightings More extensive data are available on the Rat Information Portal Users can search results from Health Department inspections for rats at the level of individual properties and view neighborhood maps by visiting httpnycgovratshttpwwwnycgovrats Prevention Simple steps can be taken to safely control these pests Report housing conditions such as water leaks holes or cracks in walls floors and ceilings and signs of rodents droppings or gnaw marks to property owners When owners fail to address these conditions NYC residents can call 311 to report the problem Use caulk and plaster to seal holes and cracks in walls floors and ceilings Store food in sealed containers and do not put out food for stray cats pigeons or squirrels Remove garbage daily from apartments and put garbage on the curb as close to pickup time as possible Use hard plastic or metal cans with tight fitting lids Reduce clutter and piling of newspapers and cardboard Keep landscaped areas around properties free of tall weeds and trim shrubs that are close to the ground Control pests safely and effectively Commercial and multiunit property owners must hire a pest control company to place rodent baits Employ pest control services that use preventive measures not just pesticides Rodent bait should only be used in enclosed tamperproof containers Get together with your neighbors to address mice and rat problems on your block or neighborhood Clean up several yards in the same area and encourage buildings near you to work with you to reduce garbage problems weeds or clutter that attract rodents This way reinfestation from nearby rodents is less likely Key Messages Beginning in 2008 the Department of Health began to systematically and proactively evaluate the presence of rats in Bronx neighborhoods in a program referred to as rat indexing By rapidly notifying property owners providing detailed advice on how to improve conditions and by engaging the public the Department now encourages whole blocks and neighborhoods to simultaneously concentrate their resources to maximize the effect of extermination and cleanup

noise is sound from an environmental source such as traffic construction industrial or recreation activities animals or peoples voices that is unwanted to the person who hears it Noise and the Environment Exposure to any noise has long been recognized as an important occupational health hazard in workplaces and is increasingly viewed as a prevalent urban environmental hazard associated with adverse psychosocial and physiologic health effects such as sleep disturbance higher blood pressure cardiovascular disease and impaired cognitive performance in children About the Data and Indicators This report defines disruptive noise exposure as any ambient noise from outside the home that disrupts activities such as watching television listening to the radio having a conversation or sleeping to the person who hears it FDNE is defined as experiencing noise disruption three or more times per week Like most cities in the United States New York City NYC does not systematically monitor ambient noise or the prevalence of noise disturbance However the city tracks noise complaints through the NYC 311 call system and enforces the New York City Noise Code 311 complaint data do not allow a full understanding of the burden of ambient noise because they may not capture information about all noise exposure some New Yorkers are more likely to call about noise and some types of noise are most likely to generate a complaint Thus to gain a better understanding of noise disturbance among all New Yorkers the Community Health Survey asked adults about how often they were disrupted by noise within the previous three months and about sources of disruptive noise Prevention To reduce environmental noise one can consider the following methods a Control at noise sources It is often a primary consideration to reduce noise at its source Whenever possible quieter working methods or technologies should be used b Noise reduction at the transmission path An obvious way of reducing noise is to separate the sources of noise from noise sensitive uses Options to avoid or minimize noise say through adopting alternative transport such as railway pedestrian link cycling path underground roads can also be considered at the early planning stage c Protection at the receiver end By arranging noise sensitive uses such as bedrooms facing away from the noise sources or acoustic insulation by good glazing the impact of noise on the receiver end can be reduced Key Messages Ambient noise in the home work or school often disrupts peoples concentration According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthhttpwwwcdcgovniosh ambient noise also affects peoples health by increasing general stress levels and aggravating stressrelated conditions such as high blood pressure coronary disease peptic ulcers and migraine headaches Continued exposure does not lead to habituation in fact the effects worsen The National Institute for Occupational Safety and

an action plan to reduce injuries and deaths on city streets Vision Zero is a multiagency effort incorporating road engineering traffic enforcement community outreach and education and policy work to make NYC streets safer Traffic Safety and the Environment Many factors contribute to traffic injuries including human vehicle and environmental factors The built environment influences traffic injury outcomes by shaping the actions of road users which can prevent crashes from happening as well as mitigating the effects of crashes when they do happen Built environment features such as road design and traffic calming strategies include pedestrian islands signal timing separated bicycle paths speed humps and bumps signage and more Environmental interventions can be tailored for a communitys

Minor injuries not treated at a hospital are not captured through emergency department and hospitalization data Data were obtained from the New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System SPARCS Transportationrelated injuries are defined by the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification ICD10CM and were recently revised The revisions largely pertain to injuryrelated diagnostic codes including those that capture transportationrelated injuries allowing for better diagnosis The Centers for Disease Control and national epidemiologists provided guidance to DOHMH for enumerating new injury codes Because the two ICD systems differ in how they classify injuries current data and previously posted data are not comparable Data prior to

is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York Citys future Goal Expand sustainable transportation choices and ensure the reliability and quality of our transportation network To measure progress towards this goal we are tracking the switch to more sustainable modes of transportation modal shift and mass transit capacity as well as whether our transportation system is meeting a state of good repair Modal Shift We are tracking the extent to which people are using nonautomobile modes of transit including public transportation eg bus subway bicycling and walking These alternative modes which use less land and create less pollution than automobiles result in less congestion and increased mobility for NYC residents To quantify the extent of the modal shift in NYC we measure the way people travel to the central business district Manhattan below 60th street as well as the way people travel citywide For travel to the central business district we look directly at changes in the percent of all trips that use nonautomobile modes of transit To track the switch to mass transit citywide we look at the relative growth of auto and transit travel demand Travel demand is highly correlated to economic activity during recessions it tends to go down and during periods of economic growth it increases To control for this economic impact we measure the relative changes in use of transit including nonmotorized travel and automobiles from the year 2000 Our goal is to increase the mass transit and nonmotorized share of travel in NYC both to the central business district and citywide Transit Capacity Increasing transit capacity will reduce traffic congestion by allowing more people to take mass transit To measure whether NYC has increased capacity we are tracking the number of transit vehicle revenue miles in the New York metropolitan area Vehicle revenue miles are miles that transit vehicles eg subway cars buses are scheduled or travel while in revenue service They do not include miles traveled without passengers or when returning to a storage depot Noncity agencies provide significant transit service to and from the city eg Long Island Rail Road Metro North Rail Road New Jersey Transit so we have included them in our computation We have also included all modes of mass transit eg bus tram ferry rail subway paratransit vehicles to ensure a complete view of transit capacity State of Good Repair Bridges and Roads NYC owns and maintains 786 bridges and related structures In the 70s and 80s the dire financial situation led to decisions to defer bridge maintenance which in turn led to declining conditions Today we apply lifecycle analyses to make strategic investments in maintenance and component replacement The approach has yielded better bridge conditions and longer life expectancy for some bridges which will both save NYC money in the long run and provide the highest safety and service for our customers The NYC Department of Transportation NYC DOT has spent 3 billion in capital construction on city bridges since 2000 With stepped up maintenance it has led to the near elimination of bridges in poor condition and an increase in bridges rated good or very good The NYC DOT goal under this program is to have all of its bridges rated in very good good or fair condition and none rated poor Bridges in fair condition or better receive routine maintenance and component replacement As they approach the low end of fair bridges are reconstructed or rehabilitated This is the most costeffective approach for the longterm maintenance of city bridges NYC DOT also tracks the road network on a biannual basis Street conditions are assessed on a scale of 110 Ratings of 7 or above indicate good condition while ratings below 7 qualify a street for resurfacing or reconstruction A certain number of streets will also be below 7 because of utility work or other issues unrelated to the road itself The goal is to have at least 85 of city streets rated at or above 7 which assumes that the remaining 15 can be scheduled for resurfacing within the next two years This translates to about 1050 lane miles resurfaced each year State of Good Repair Subway stations NYC Transits 468 passenger stations are used by millions of customers each day The system has 277 underground stations 142 on elevated structures and 49 on viaduct embankment or opencut structures In 2008 NYC Transit completed a comprehensive condition survey of all stations conducted by independent engineering consultants Over 14500 components were rated on a scale of 1 best

is the use of physical verbal andor emotional force to injure harm abuse damage or destroy Interpersonal violence includes child abuse and neglect youth violence intimate partner violence sexual violence and elder abuse Violence can involve injury to self including selfharm suicide attempts and death by suicide Violence can also take the form of power against a group or community Violence is a public health issue because it is a cause of morbidity and mortality leading to physical and emotional harm an increase in negative health outcomes premature death psychological trauma and persistent fear to individuals and communities Violence is also an equity issue because it disproportionately affects groups that have been oppressed due to their socioeconomic status raceethnicity sexual orientation gender identity geographic location or some combination of these factors Data from multiple sources illustrate tremendous disparities in the distribution and burden of violence throughout NYC For instance rates of firearmrelated violence are at least two times higher in high poverty neighborhoods when compared to lower poverty neighborhoods And violence persists as a leading cause of premature death among NYCs men of color Factors that Contribute to Violence Restricting the explanation of disparities in violence to differences in individuals and group characteristics most affected by the violence only initiates bias and constrains problemsolving To understand what drives violence it is important to look at the context and systems within which it occurs and consider the negative impact that historic practices eg redlining and ongoing social structures eg institutional racism have on particular groups and communities For example racialized systems have created and upheld stereotypes that link Black men and criminalityhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC5004736 while ignoring the imbalanced distribution of power and resources experienced by Black men and Black communities A myriad of social political economic historical and environmental factors contribute to violence These factors convey messages about which populations and communities are deprived of societys resources and which are privileged by them Some of these factors include Poverty and neighborhood disinvestment Housing and historic redlining practices Education and employment opportunities Policing and incarceration practices Chronic stress and intergenerational trauma Community and social norms Access to health and health care Built environment Racism and other forms of oppression Examining factors like these that disproportionately marginalize certain populations illuminate opportunities for prevention About the Data and Indicators Violence is frequently described through homicide statistics While it is a leading cause of death and captures the most severe form of violence nonfatal violencerelated injuries are much more common and help paint the larger picture on the burden of violence and its impact on the health and future of individuals families and communities Interpreting the Data and Informing Solutions Violencerelated data must be interpreted in ways where we move beyond demonizing those causing the harm and instead look at the context and systems that gives rise to violence Interpreting data this way illuminates ways to mitigate the social political economic historical and environmental factors that contribute to violence With any public health epidemic be it influenza obesity opioid addiction or gun violence prevention is key Prevention is achievable in ways that are similar to multipronged approaches that have been used to address the risk and resilient factors for health outcomes like asthma motor vehicle crashes and opioid overdoses

characterized by its usual weather conditions seasons and patterns in extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts and hurricanes New York City NYC faces public health risks from extreme weather events such as heat waves and coastal storms With climate change the severity of some of these risks will increase A 2013 New York City Panel on Climate Change NPCC report predicts that by the 2020s average summer temperatures in New York City will increase by 20F to 30F compared to a 19712000 baseline Heat waves will become more frequent intense and longer in duration Rainfall and precipitation are expected to increase together with another 48 inches of sea level rise and increased probability of coastal storms with flooding NPCC Climate Risk Information 2013 Weather and Health Even without longterm changes in climate New Yorkers face weatherrelated risks today Heat and humidity cause serious illness and death every summer In fact more Americans die from heat waves in a typical year than all other natural disasters combined both in direct mortality from heat stress hyperthermia also known as heat stroke and by way of increases in the rates of deaths from natural causes due to the exacerbation of other medical conditions While far less common coastal storms can also have serious consequences including longterm mental health impacts In 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and damage in New York City and resulted in at least 44 deaths Power outages can also occur during heat waves and coastal storms Potential health impacts include gastrointestinal illness due to food spoilage carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of generators and illness and death among the medically frail due to mechanical equipment failure and inability to obtain medical care or extreme exertion such as having to climb many flights of stairs in highrise buildings due to elevator outages Lack of air conditioning or home heat may also result in heat and coldrelated illnesses About the Data and Indicators The Tracking Portal provides data on counts and rates of death hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for heat stress While these cases can be readily identified with hyperthermia listed as a diagnosis or cause of death it is important to note that they reflect only a portion of the overall health impact of extreme heat Increases in naturalcause hospitalization and death rates during heat waves from cardiovascular disease diabetes and renal disease for example may be estimated using statistical methods The Tracking Portal also provides counts and rates of hospital admission and treatment in an emergency department for cold stress As with heat stress data is important to note that cold stress data reflect only a portion of the overall health impact and does not account for potential increases in hospital visits for other conditions that can be exacerbated by cold exposure such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease for example Prevention Air conditioning is the most important way to prevent heat stress and death on hot days Those most vulnerable to heat stress include older adults and people with health conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes mental illness or cognitive impairments Set air conditioners to 78F or lowcool to provide comfort while not wasting energy Check on family friends and neighbors atrisk and assist them in staying cool and well hydrated Living without heat or being outdoors in cold weather for a prolonged time can be dangerous Stay indoors as much as possible When outdoors wear layers of warm clothing and cover exposed skin If your home lacks heat get to a warm place if you can and wear warm clothes Report loss of heat or hot water to property managers immediately and call 311 Seniors should take extra care outdoors to avoid slips and falls from icy conditions Protect yourself and your family from carbon monoxide CO poisoninghttpwww1nycgovassetsdohdownloadspdfpublicdohmhnews1001pdf Make sure your home has a working smoke alarm and CO detector If a CO detector goes off in your home immediately open a nearby window go outside for fresh air and call 911 NEVER run a vehicle inside a garage or against a snowbank Clear snow from your cars tailpipe before running the engine Check on neighbors friends and relatives For more information on preparing for weather hazards including heat cold coastal storms and power outages visit the DOHMH extreme weather websitehttpwww1nycgovsitedohhealthemergencypreparednessthreatspage Key Messages About 80 of heat stroke victims in New York City are overcome by excessively hot conditions in their own homes as indoor temperatures in the urban environment may be even hotter than outdoor temperatures when an air conditioner is not available or not in use Although heatrelated mortality rates are lower than in historical periods before electricity and air conditioning it is possible that rates may rise as a result of climate change depending on the extent of adaptation In 2011 a Health Department survey estimated that 25 of New York City adults still do not have or rarely use air conditioning during hot summer weather many of whom may be at increased risk of heat stress due to age or poor health People most likely to be exposed to dangerous cold include those who lack shelter work outdoors andor live in homes with malfunctioning or inadequate heat Seniors infants people with chronic

100 locations around NYC Weve combined these measurements with data on things related to air quality like traffic building emissions green space and much more to model seasonal air quality in every New York City neighborhood Our full findings are available in our annual report but here are a few other interesting things weve found along the way Additional health threats of traffic volume Traffic is a part of life in New York City and urban areas around the world While transportation is critical to a healthy functioning city it can also contribute to poor health and quality of life for both commuters and residents NYCCAS air monitoring data shows that traffic is associated with higher levels of harmful pollutants NO2 PM25 and black carbon BC In addition studies show that traffic is associated with two more health threats air toxics and noise Air toxics Air toxics are air pollutants that increase the risk of cancer and other serious health effects A study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that 49 of New York City residents live in census tracts that exceed a common benchmark for cancer risk because of exposure to benzene and formaldehyde compared with 48 of the population nationwide To further understand New Yorkers exposure to these air toxics we measured air toxics including benzene formaldehyde and other compounds at 70 sites across the city in 2011 We found that average levels of benzene and formaldehyde varied across NYC with some sites showing two three or even six times more air toxics than cleaner sites mostly due to traffic volume congestion and fuelburning buildings functionuse strictwindowaddEventListenermessagefunctionaifvoid 0adatadatawrapperheightforvar e in adatadatawrapperheightvar

survey showed that one in five adult New Yorkers experience noise that disrupts sleep and other home life three or more times per week and some highpoverty neighborhoods experience even greater rates of noise disruption Noise is more than an annoyance it can cause stress increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease and interfere with cognitive development in children To measure noise levels we collected weeklong sound pressure measurements at 56 sites across the city by mounting small soundlevel meters on lampposts in 2012 We found that for weeklong average values All sites exceeded noise guidelines set by the EPA and World Health Organization to protect health and quality of life 55 dBA Over half of sites exceeded EPA noise guidelines to prevent hearing loss 70 dBA The highest noise levels were recorded during the daytime hours of weekdays in areas where there was a lot of traffic within 100 meters Its no surprise that where there are high levels of noise there are also high levels of air pollution from vehicles Reducing emissions of both noise and air pollution from vehicles and other sources would improve health and quality of life in many of our most burdened

Northeast is the nations largest consumer of heating oil We use these fuels year round in building boiler systems for heat and hot water New York City has been phasing out the dirtiest heating fuel with high amounts of sulfur through recent City and State regulations These heating fuel regulations will be fully implemented by 2030 NYCCAS data shows that neighborhoods with higher proportions of buildings that burn highsulfur heating oil have worse air pollution So how can we estimate the public health benefits of cleaner heating fuel To estimate the impact of those heating oil regulations we used model simulations Heres what we did We gathered emissions data using boiler permits and other buildings and emissions data to see how boiler emissions changed after the regulations were put in place We estimated the resulting change in PM25 concentration using a complex air quality computer model that combines emissions information meteorology data and simulations of atmospheric chemical reactions This map shows estimated reductions in PM25 by neighborhood from 2008 before the regulations took effect to 2030 when the regulations will be fully implemented functionuse

reductions in areas with the worst air quality Cleaner fuels will save the most lives in areas with the greatest reduction in PM25 and areas with the highest rates of baseline premature mortality These are the neighborhoods that already have poor air quality and high rates of death including the Upper East and West Sides and Northern Manhattan Fewer adverse health events throughout the city Cleaner fuels will result in reductions in other health events throughout the city notably in the Bronx and Brooklyn Even in neighborhoods with better air quality hospitalizations and emergency department visits for cardiovascular disease asthma emergency department visits and respiratory diseases will go down as PM25 levels drop In other words reducing PM25 benefits areas that have high

city life changes so does its air quality as sources of emissions that affect the citys outdoor air quality like truck traffic building boilers and restaurants also change For more than a decade we have been tracking air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey NYCCAS and exploring the factors that drive neighborhood differences We have found some interesting changes in the sources of air pollution across NYC neighborhoods NYCCAS is the largest urban air monitoring program in the country We measure air pollution at nearly 100 locations around the city and use landuse and other emissions data in a statistical model to identify the factors most closely associated with different pollutants Lets look at PM25 or fine particles PM25 is the most harmful urban pollutant It can cause cancer worsen heart and lung disease and lead to premature death PM25 levels vary across the city and the pollutant comes from a lot of different sources the most important of which had been building boilers We have been able to accurately estimate or model PM25 concentrations by looking at data on building boilers which burn fossil fuels to generate heat and hot water and release PM25 PM25 is either emitted by combustion or form in the atmosphere out of other pollutants Its the most harmful air pollutant it gets into our lungs and bloodstream and worsens heart and lung disease You can see in the chart below that neighborhoods with high building density have reliably higher wintertime concentrations of PM25 than medium or lowdensity neighborhoods Since theres seasonal variation in PM25 concentration its easier to look at one season at a time You can also see that the wintertime PM25 concentrations have gone down dramatically over time largely because the city has required buildings to reduce emissions Local Law 43 of 2010 outlawed the burning of heavy fuel oil Number 6 in New York City buildings requiring buildings to switch to cleaner fuels In 2012 New York State lowered the allowed sulfur content of Number 2 fuel oil which further cleaned up building emissions Meanwhile emissions from another source commercial cooking has gone up according to emissions estimates Commercial cooking refers to cooking in restaurants especially meat cooked on grills or charbroilers The smoke this creates is vented out of the building and contributes to PM25 measured by NYCCAS The National Emissions Inventory NEI is a detailed estimate of air pollution emissions from all the sources of pollution including vehicles building heating commercial cooking construction factories and power plants among other manmade and natural sources The inventories include criteria pollutants like PM25 NO2 and ozone and hazardous air pollutants like mercury benzene and asbestos Learn more about the NEI We can see these trends in our PM25 landuse regression model which links neighborhood factors to measured pollution and allows us to estimate pollution levels in places where we dont measure it Our model tells us which emissions sources explain the differences across neighborhoods Pollutant levels can vary significantly from one neighborhood to another For example in 2018 the seasonal average PM25 concentration across NYCCAS monitoring sites ranged from 34 to 165 micrograms per cubic meter Get more air quality data at the NYCCAS Annual Report With the increase in commercial cooking emissions our model shows that the number of restaurants with permits for grills or charbroilers in a neighborhood is now a better predictor of PM25 concentrations than building density and explains most of the variation across the city What can we do about this In 2015 New York City took a step forward in addressing this pollutant source when City Council passed Local Law 38 which updated the NYC Air Code to include commercial cooking emissions Following input from an advisory committee made up of representatives from health and environmental organizations as well as the restaurant industry the New York City Department of Environmental Protection created regulations requiring the registration of commercial charbroilers and the installation of emissions control devices on new grills and charbroilers in restaurants that cook significant amounts of meat Like with building boiler emissions knowing where charbroilers are located will help us better understand the impact on neighborhood air quality With this information government and industry must think creatively about how to support all impacted restaurants large and small in reducing emissions from commercial cooking Together NYC can continue to clean up its air and protect the lungs of New Yorkers"},{"title":"What our air quality monitors tell us about NYC's

100 air quality monitors to see if air quality improves in areas that go carfree And the answer is yes NYCCAS tells us that more traffic means more air pollution nearby So even if we dont have a nearby monitor we can predict that an area that goes carfree like Park Drive in Prospect Park for example sees an improvement in air quality NYCCAS detects neighborhood differences We combine NYCCAS data with other data to make reliable estimates about air quality all across the city This lets us compare neighborhoods based on their characteristics and track trends over time For example when we group neighborhoods based on traffic high medium or low traffic density we can see that hightraffic neighborhoods have more PM25 than medium and lowtraffic neighborhoods Interestingly mediumtraffic neighborhoods and lowtraffic neighborhoods see similar levels of PM25 pollution Only with high traffic density do we see higher pollution levels You can also see that PM25 is a little higher in the winter and summer for all neighborhoods regardless of traffic density Pollution levels vary by season due changes in energy use heating and cooling and weather patterns Air quality has been improving NYCs air quality has been improving Over the last ten years NYCCAS has shown an improvement each of the pollutants we monitor Because the level of PM25 varies by season it can be helpful to look at one season at a time The chart below shows the average summertime levels of PM25 You can see that air quality has gotten better across all neighborhoods regardless of traffic density NYCCAS was designed to record trends like this and to measure big broad changes If we want to make big air quality changes well need big interventions create large carfree zones reduce traffic volume and place greater restrictions on harmful emissions Bad air is bad for you In NYC we estimate that each year more than 2000 people die prematurely and more than 6000 people go to the emergency room because of health conditions made worse by breathing PM25 Thats one out of every 20 deaths in New York City and thats just from one pollutant So those big changes From the benefits we would get they may be well worth the cost And NYCCAS is leading the way to identify ways to continue improving the air and the health of all those who breathe it"},{"title":"Air quality during

outbreak has affected many aspects of our daily life but there are also less apparent effects such as impacts on our environment The NYC Community Air Survey uses air quality monitors to take hourly measurements of fine particulate PM25 at a few sites around the city Generally locations around the city see changes in PM25 levels driven by time of day air quality gets worse during rush hour and business hours and weather conditions which can trap pollution in the city or blow it in from other states As New York City and surrounding communities implemented measures to slow the spread of COVID19 however the citys air quality changed significantly For example when we look at air quality in Midtown Manhattan we can decreasing PM25 levels as NYC began to stay home PM25 levels tend to be lower in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer so it is normal to see levels going down during March and early April However hightraffic sites such as midtown Manhattan usually have consistently higher levels of PM25 than lowtraffic sites Starting in the spring the midtown sites PM25 levels were much closer than usual to the lowtraffic Queens reference location In addition to these unusually low PM25 levels there was a sizeable decrease in nitrogen dioxide a pollutant which mostly comes from traffic The following data is measured by the NYS Department of Environmental

we turn to the NYC Community Air Survey or NYCCAS NYCCAS is our network of air quality monitors around the city NYCCAS monitors air with nearly 100 sensors across the city NYCCAS air quality monitor sites Routine site environmental justice site retired site We use these monitors to measure levels of six different pollutants fine particles PM25 nitrogen dioxide NO2 nitric oxide NO sulfur dioxide SO2 ozone O3 and black carbon BC Then we combine these data with information about sources of emissions traffic volume wind patterns and more to model the air quality all across the city including in places where there are no air quality monitors This tells us how air pollution differs between neighborhoods and why For example it can tell us whether air quality is better or worse in neighborhoods that have parks compared to neighborhoods without parks What happens to air quality when an area goes carfree We can look at changes to Times Square to understand what happens to local air quality when a street is relieved of car traffic Starting in the summer of 2009 five blocks of Broadway through Times Square and some adjacent space were closed to cars increasing the amount of plaza space available for pedestrians NYCCAS nearby air quality monitor measured the air pollutants before and after the change With this monitor we could see whether redirecting traffic led to any changes in air quality First lets look at NO a pollutant that primarily comes from car emissions In early 2009 Times Squares NO concentration was higher than the average concentration in Midtown But when Times Square went carfree the NO concentration fell to below the Midtown average NO went down Did other pollutants Next lets look at PM25 This pollutant comes from traffic emissions but it also comes from other sources like buildings which like vehicles burn fuel power plants and construction In winter 2008 Times Squares PM25 was a little bit higher than the Midtown average Unlike NO the PM25 concentration in Times Square didnt change much Thats because there are a lot more sources of PM25 in the area like buildings On the other hand most of the NO in the air comes from vehicle emissions That means that when you remove traffic youll remove a lot of the NO in the air What does this mean for other carfree areas The Times Square monitor shows us that a local change in traffic can result in a measurable change in local air quality for some pollutants Other parts of the city have reduced traffic like on 14th Street in Manhattan with 14th Street Busway We dont have an air monitor there but we dont need one we can use the data that goes into the NYCCAS model which includes building density building emissions industrial areas and traffic density and other localized findings like about what happened in Times Square to understand how the air quality changes based on reductions in traffic volume So while we dont have a monitor in every place that has gone carfree like the 14th Street Busway or Prospect Park we can use what we learned from Times Square to safely conclude that removing traffic from an area can improve the air quality particularly for pollutants that mostly come from vehicle emissions We continue to explore the data collected through NYCCAS in Part 2"},{"title":"Disparities in

immediate people harmed It ripples throughout a community affecting family members loved ones friends and neighbors Violence is a pressing public health threat Violence is a real and pressing public health threat and it doesnt affect New Yorkers equally We can look at violence by looking at data on nonfatal assault hospitalizations violence that results in somebody going to the hospital but not dying While the hospitalization data capture where the person injured in the assault lives and not where the assault occurred they can be interpreted as indicators of violence in the neighborhood In this map we can see that the highest rates of nonfatal assault hospitalizations the darkest shades of purple on the map are concentrated in the Bronx parts of Harlem northeastern Brooklyn and northern Staten Island Hospitalization rates for these neighborhoods are nearly 4 times the Citys average These higher rates of violence means that the health consequences ripple throughout the residents of these neighborhoods often with devastating consequences A major inequity is driving these different rates poverty Violence is highest in NYC neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty Any adverse health outcome that affects one population more than another a health inequity deserves special scrutiny New York Citys highpoverty neighborhoods which also have a higher percentage of residents of color were created and maintained by systemic racism and historical disinvestment The resulting higher rates of violence that exist in these communities create an unjust health disparity experienced

breathe can have a major effect on our health air pollution can make asthma worse and can cause heart disease lung disease strokes and even cancer Fortunately New York City has made great strides in recent years to improve air quality Lets take a look An air quality advisory day happens when air pollution builds up to dangerous levels It means that people who are sensitive to air pollution like people with respiratory or heart problems should spend less time outside and avoid outdoor exercise If the air quality is bad enough then most people will be affected by it Over the years though the number of advisory days has gone down Thats good news for everyone who breathes Whats behind this improvement Since the winter of 20082009 the Health Department has been measuring air quality through the NYC Community Air Survey NYCCAS Its the largest urban air monitoring program in the USA and measures six different kinds of air pollution at about 100 locations around the city Because of NYCCAS weve been able to measure improvements in air quality that are in part due to City regulations and policies For example Efforts by the City to phase out residual heating oil the dirtiest kind have helped wintertime levels of sulfur dioxide go down by 96 percent Citywide average levels for 4 other pollutants have gone down by between 26 and 44 percent A closer look at PM25 in the air One major component of air pollution Fine particles in the air called PM25 We breathe them in and they enter our lungs and bloodstream where they can cause health problems In New York City the current PM25 levels contribute to an estimated 2300 deaths from lung and heart disease each year That means about 1 out of every 20 deaths in New York City is due to this type of air pollution So its good news that since monitoring neighborhoodlevel air pollution began in 2009 the levels of PM25 have steadily gone down which you can see in the chart below By burning heating oil New York Citys buildings are responsible for about 50 percent of the citys PM25 emissions and traffic is responsible for another 17 percent see a data story on the Public Health Impacts of PM25 from Air Pollution That means that reducing traffic and working to make sure that buildings burn cleaner fuel are great ways to clean up the air and help keep our air cleaner and both are important parts of OneNYC the citys sustainability plan But since 45 percent of PM25 in NYC comes from outside the city rollbacks of federal regulations like the Clean Power Plan will also affect the quality of our air The City is providing comments to the Environmental Protection Agency in support of stricter emissions standards for power plants cars and trucks so that NYCs air quality continues to improve PM25 is only one piece of the puzzle While NYCCAS has let us see ways that air quality has improved it also identifies areas where we can make better progress For example weve learned that Average ozone levels in the summer havent changed in the past 10 years There are higher levels of pollutants in areas of higher traffic density building density and in industrial areas Measuring air quality means we can track improvements and challenges and push for changes in our city and the nation that will reduce air pollution and keep New Yorkers healthy Here at the Health Department well continue monitoring air quality just as we measure levels of asthma heart disease and lung disease that can be attributed in part to air pollution As air quality improves we expect decreases in disease rates good news for us

billion times a year To help keep diners safe the Health Department educates restaurant operators about food safety practices and inspects all 27000 city restaurants at least once a year Over 90 percent of NYC restaurants have A grades in the window showing excellent compliance with food safety requirements However warmer weather creates special challenges keeping food safe We dug into the data to find out how hot weather affects food safety Some background on foodborne illnesses Though most foodborne illnesses are relatively minor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are 128000 hospitalizations and 3000 deaths per year from foodborne illnesses in the USA Many of these are viruses and bacteria that spread through unsafe food handling practices For example if bacteria from raw meat or eggs contaminate other readytoeat food it can make people sick Food safety inspectors work to keep you safe When you eat at a restaurant youre placing your trust in both the restaurant and in our food safety inspectors The Health Department employs about 100 of them and they visit each of nearly 27000 NYC restaurants at least once per year to make sure restaurants meet Health Code requirements Restaurants receive an inspection score which gets converted into the letter grade you see posted in the window As part of the inspection process food safety inspectors educate restaurant operators about food safety practices and collect data on violations they observe Then our team at the Health Department analyzes the inspection data to identify common violations and understand patterns in the violations We use this data to figure out what food safety practices need improvement helping to reduce risks to customers like you Hot weather and food safety Certain foodborne illnesses increase in the summertime possibly because bacteria are more likely to multiply in warmer temperatures Potentially hazardous cold food needs to be stored at or below 41 F to minimize the growth of microorganisms that can make you sick Cold holding violations not storing food at or below 41 F are one of the most common violations that our food safety inspectors find When potentially hazardous foods like meat poultry fish and cut melons arent kept cold enough bacteria can multiply rapidly We investigated how outdoor temperature affects restaurant food safety patterns To do this we analyzed data from 64661 inspections that took place over five summers Of these inspections 45 percent found cold holding violations We looked at inspections conducted on higher and lower maximum temperature days and we found a 20 percent increase in cold food holding violations on the hottest days 93 or higher compared with average summer days temperatures around 82 We talked over our findings with restaurant staff After reviewing these data we convened restaurant operators to talk about common challenges to keeping food cool For example they told us that in the hot weather refrigerators can break down or stop working due to shortterm power outages If these outages happen while the restaurant is closed it can be hard to know how long the fridge was out and how long the food was warming up These conversations helped us learn more about the challenges that extreme temperatures power outages and other emergencies pose for food safety Working to keep you safe To help keep you safe from foodborne illnesses a supervisor trained in all aspects of food safety must be present at all times while a restaurant is open for business Supervisors must have a food protection certificate from the NYC Health Academy the Health Departments training facility and food safety inspectors look for this certificate during inspections Inspectors discuss problems they find during inspections with restaurant staff and discuss how to correct them The Health Department also monitors data from electric utilities and emails restaurants if theyve lost power for 90 minutes or more so that restaurants can take action to safeguard food and protect their customers These measures go a long way to keeping people safe But by analyzing data from inspections we continue to identify ways to improve our work and that of the restaurants we regulate If you want to make sure that your favorite restaurant is taking the right steps to keep you

climate continues to warm so the Health Department is working to prepare our residents and communities Older adults are more likely to die from extreme heat because of being more likely to have chronic illnesses and economic concerns However Black New Yorkers die from heat at younger ages They are often younger when they develop chronic medical conditions and are more likely to have more than one condition Crucially longstanding systemic health and social inequities have put Black New Yorkers at increased risk of getting sick and dying from extreme heat Structural racism also results in higher unemployment rates fewer job opportunities lower pay and greater job instability for Black New Yorkers affecting financial stability We identified environmental housing and social factors

place matters What determines whether or not youre healthy You may think about what you eat whether you exercise whether you smoke and your family medical history But you may not think about how your

words a healthy home is a wellmaintained home But some buildings arent healthy places to live Buildings with maintenance issues and disrepair can harm health Across NYC lowincome neighborhoods have a higher percentage of buildings in disrepair and Black and Latino people have less access to healthy housing Todays inequality can be traced to a history of racism and neglect a practice known as redlining resulted in segregation which in turn drove housing disrepair and led to these health disparities Lets explore how Racism has determined where people live since colonial times Racism has always played a role in residential patterns in New York City When New York City was a Dutch colony it was just the southern tip of Manhattan Wall Street got its name from the citys protective wall In 1661 when Black people petitioned the colony for land in the area they were given land north of the wall outside of the city proper Throughout history many different practices have shaped racial and residential patterns in New York City In the 20th century a practice called redlining made racism a federal policy with longlasting repercussions for our housing and our health Federal policy drove residential segregation In the 1930s the federal government developed colorcoded maps to guide loans to potential home buyers in cities across the US In the 1930s the Great Depression caused a wave of foreclosures throughout the country Unemployment rates were high and many people couldnt make mortgage payments To help keep people in their homes the federal government established the Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Its goal was to refinance mortgages with better terms less interest and a longer repayment times This would help people make payments and avoid foreclosure However to determine what loans they could safely guarantee HOLC sent people to appraise neighborhoods in cities across the USA and generated the discriminatory redlining maps that would guide the real estate industry for decades On these colorcoded maps neighborhoods were divided into 4 categories Best Still desirable Definitely declining Hazardous This classification was clearly rooted in racism since neighborhood descriptions included statements like Detrimental influences Infiltration of Negroes Mixed races The government denied loans to Black and Latino people trying to buy homes in redlined neighborhoods Instead these resources went to new Whiteonly suburban communities The map below shows how New York Citys neighborhoods were categorized This was redlining This process became known as redlining systematically denying public and private resources based on where people live targeting people of color Redlining helped drive urban segregation in the 20th century as new neighborhoods were built for white people while people of color were forced into neighborhoods declared to be declining Since homeownership is an important way to accrue wealth redlining drove economic inequality too by denying people of color the same opportunities for home ownership that white people had Other discriminatory practices maintain segregation Other real estate practices like BlockbustingnbspContract selling nbspRacially restrictive covenants have maintained segregation Blockbusting was a practice used by real estate agents Since many white people viewed people of color as a social and economic threat to their neighborhoods agents would tell white homeowners that people of color were about to move into the neighborhood This would convince homeowners that their houses value would fall and they would sell for a lower price Real estate agents would then turn around and sell property to people of color for inflated prices Contract selling was a deceptive and exploitative real estate practice that targeted people of color with private loans to buy homes These loans often had high interests rates and manipulative terms in some cases forcing the buyer to give up their home if they missed even one loan payment These contracts often made people responsible for paying back far more money than the house they bought was worth A raciallyrestrictive covenant is a clause in the deed for a property that prevents the owner from selling the property to people of color Raciallyrestrictive covenants were a way to enforce residential segregation to ensure that people of color were kept out of white neighborhoods Today housing advocates say that some landlords continue discriminatory practices describing one landlords behavior this way This landlord has a pattern of buying old worn out buildings in working class neighborhoods of color letting the apartments of longterm tenants fall into disrepair and making them wait months for lowquality repairs Many tenants also say that this landlord gives preferential treatment to new tenants from the Right to Counsel NYC Coalition Worst Evictors List These practices continue a legacy of housing racism maintain residential segregation and over time result in disinvestment when neighborhoods are deprived of resources that their residents need for health and opportunity Disinvestment led to housing disrepair Throughout the 20th century redlined neighborhoods deteriorated as they were deprived of private investment and government resources Landlords in these neighborhoods are less likely to adequately maintain homes As a result many homes have severe and chronic maintenance problems Explore NYCs common housing problems in the map below Percent of households with healthy housing problems Healthy housing problems No

people die from extreme heat than from all other natural disasters combined To understand how to keep New Yorkers safe from extreme heat we studied neighborhood factors that affect temperature and found that grass shrubs and trees can play a major role Lets take a look At 600 PM on June 30 2018 the air temperature at the LaGuardia Airport Weather Station was 89 Fahrenheit F At the same time the air temperature on a block in East Harlem below left was nearly 5 hotter than at the Weather Station and the temperature on a block in BedStuy below right was 35 hotter 100th St between Lexington and 3rd Ave Manhattan 939 F Stuyvesant Ave between Jefferson and Putnam Brooklyn 925 F This is an example of the Urban Heat Island Effect when some areas in a city are hotter than others Temperatures can even vary from block to block LaGuardia Airport is an open space without many structures surrounding it It doesnt trap heat the way other places in the city do so we often use it as a reference temperature It is almost always cooler than other parts of NYC where building boilers and vehicle engines generate heat manufactured surfaces like roofs and roads absorb heat and theres less vegetation to cool things down What cools your block Anyone who has looked for a shady spot under a tree on a hot sunny day knows that trees help to cool off a street But by how much How effective are trees at cooling neighborhoods and what other characteristics contribute to an areas air temperature during hot weather To find out how trees and other characteristics affect hyperlocal temperature blockbyblock differences we worked with the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Mayors Office of Climate and Resiliency to install air temperature monitors around the city This was part of a comprehensive approach to keep neighborhoods cooler during hot weather in NYC We reviewed landuse data and satellite imagery to build a profile of each block where we were monitoring temperature We found that temperature could vary significantly depending on block characteristics For example the block we studied in Brownsville Brooklyn had very little vegetation trees grass and shrubs while the block in Edenwald in the Bronx had high grass and tree coverage You can see the difference in vegetation coverage in these satellite images We found that the average temperature at the Edenwald spot was more than 2 cooler than the Brownsville spot Brownsville Brooklyn Measure Tree canopy Low Grassshrubs Low Building height Low Average temp 82 Edenwald the Bronx Measure Tree canopy High Grassshrubs High Building height Medium Average temp 798 These are the factors we explored that affect hyperlocal temperature Tree canopy coverage Total tree canopy coverage is the percent of the sidewalk in the right of way of the monitored street that is shaded by trees Trees provide shade and prevent the ground from heating up They also can cool the air through evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration happens when the suns rays hit plants causing water to evaporate from the leaves This change from liquid to vapor cools the plants just as sweating cools our bodies and uses energy thereby reducing the amount of energy left to warm the air Grass and shrubs The percent of grass and shrubs in front of buildings on the monitored street Grass and shrubs cool the air through shading and evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration happens when the suns rays hit plants causing water to evaporate from the leaves This change from liquid to vapor cools the plants just as sweating cools our bodies and uses energy thereby reducing the amount of energy left to warm the air Building height Our model looks at the median building height the middle of the range of sorted heights of buildings on the block Taller buildings can absorb and reflect more heat increasing the streets temperature but at about 3 or more floors begin to cool the street by shading it Impervious surfaces Impervious surfaces are made from asphalt concrete astroturf and even hardpacked dirt These surfaces absorb sunlight and reflect and retain heat They increase the temperature of the surrounding area Other factors Other factors like the orientation of the street NorthSouth or EastWest how close the area is to the ocean the elevation of the area daily wind speed and weather patterns can also influence how hot a block is What factors matter the most We built a statistical model that predicts the average summer temperature on a hypothetical city block based on the neighborhood factors we studied in the hyperlocal temperature study We modeled the average temperature from 6 to 9PM when the Urban Heat Island Effect is the greatest the sun sets but the city retains heat Our model looked at how much each factor affected temperature and it showed that the most important factor for reducing temperature was green space trees grass and shrubs reduce temperature Having more surfaces that hold heat increases temperature See for yourself drag the green slider back and forth to see what the temperature would be on a hypothetical block if there were more vegetation or more impervious surfaces like

health we often cite structural racism to help explain health patterns in our society But what specifically does this mean A close look at the history of redlining shows this connection When we analyze data on the health of New Yorkers we often find the same geographic patterns with higher rates of preventable health conditions in highpoverty neighborhoods For example weve written about how asthma and poverty are closely connected These highpoverty neighborhoods are also home to a higher proportion of people of color than other communities The chart below shows the relationship between each neighborhoods poverty rate and percent population of color with the rate of childhood asthma ED visits represented by the size of each bubble This dynamic extends beyond asthma To understand why poverty race and health are related in New York City we look back at redlining This government policy from the 1930s illustrates the nature of poverty and racism in our society and how racism affects health A Brief History of Redlining In the 1930s during the Great Depression unemployment rates were high and many people couldnt make their mortgage payments A wave of foreclosures swept the country To help keep people in their homes the federal government established the Home Owners Loan Corporation HOLC Its goal was to refinance mortgages with better terms like lower interest rates and longer repayment periods to help people make payments and avoid foreclosure To determine what loans they would guarantee HOLC sent people to appraise neighborhoods in cities across the US They documented the types of housing in neighborhoods along with information about the people who lived there They also catalogued detrimental influences with racist descriptions like infiltration of Negroes and mixed races as characteristics that lowered a neighborhoods value A redlining document that details housing construction type average age repair condition occupancy price range and other information A redining document that reads Detrimental influences Obsolescence and poor maintenance Infiltration of Negroes Elevated structures on Lexington Ave Fulton Grand Avenue Mixed races With this information HOLC made residential security maps for almost 250 cities including New York City On these maps HOLC gave each neighborhood a classification Best Still desirable Definitely declining Hazardous The government used these classifications to determine whether to guarantee loans Banks used them to determine if people were eligible for mortgages and wouldnt provide loans to buy homes in the declining or hazardous neighborhoods This was redlining drawing boundaries around neighborhoods based on residents race and depriving them of resources and opportunities effectively racializing poverty in cities across the US This is structural racism where racism is built into the rules of society The map below shows the extent of redlining in New York City Redlining drove residential segregation As a result of redlining people of color were denied access to desirable neighborhoods by racist real estate practices and denied loans to buy homes in neighborhoods labeled declining or hazardous Real estate agents also used exploitative tactics like blockbusting contract selling and racially restrictive covenants to deepen and enforce neighborhood segregation Blockbusting was a practice used by real estate agents Since many white people viewed people of color as a social and economic threat to their neighborhoods agents would tell white homeowners that people of color were about to move into

were a way to enforce residential segregation to ensure that people of color were kept out of white neighborhoods Owning a home is a powerful way to achieve financial stability These policies

transportation As more New Yorkers use bicycles lets take a look at safety on our streets Cyclist safety in public health data New York Citys streets offer opportunities for active transportation like cycling and walking but can also pose risks from collisions We had a stark reminder of that in 2019 when 28 cyclists died on NYC streets following an historic low of 10 in 2018 We can look at data to understand how to maximize health promotion and minimize risk Public health data include hospitalization and emergency department ED data which track injuries to cyclists as well as pedestrians Along with these injury statistics we have data on traffic density eg measured in vehicle miles travelled on specific roads infrastructure eg the presence of bike lanes and cycling eg how many people

13 percent of streets do This is consistent with research that shows that bicycle networks offer protection to people on the streets Safety in numbers The idea of safety in numbers comes from a study that found that a motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle This is probably because as the number of people walking and cycling increases motorists become more attentive So as the number of cyclists rises we expect to see injury rates go down Ongoing work to promote cycling will help lower injury rates Expanding bike share networks increasing bicycle network coverage and continuing to build protective street environments like separated bike lanes can get more riders on the street and offer them greater protection This effect is apparent when we look at differences between Manhattan and Brooklyn and apply what we learn throughout the city Disparities in cycling by sex raceethnicity age and neighborhood poverty also need to be addressed through equitably focused safety improvements since safety in numbers works best if we increase safety for everyone starting where it is most needed As New York City continues to grapple with the COVID19 pandemic many New Yorkers may turn to biking as a good way to get around while still keeping a safe distance from others Our data show us that there is a clear connection between road infrastructure and street safety That means that one way to keep New Yorkers safe during this public health emergency and beyond is to continue building safer streets Questions about this data story

px A public health approach to addressing violence Residents of some neighborhoods are at much greater risk of experiencing violence and its many health effects To prevent violence among those most affected by it we need to explore what factors lead to it Violence is rooted in historical disinvestment and racism Evidence shows that violence results from social structures that limit access to basic needs structures that are fueled by racism residential segregation and neighborhood disinvestment Where these structures persist people are exposed to violence For example lowincome neighborhoods of color are known to be hit the hardest This map shows the parts of NYC that were redlined 90 years ago as part of racist housing policy that set off decades of disinvestment and intergenerational poverty Redlining was a federal policy that started in the 1930s A government agency drew maps of hundreds of cities throughout the USA and graded neighborhoods within them from Best to Hazardous Their criteria included the race of people who lived in those neighborhoods Both the federal government and private banks used these maps to determine whether or not to back loans so that people could buy homes Through this system people of color were denied the opportunity to buy homes and white people had their home purchases federally subsidized Redlining drove segregation and economic inequality along racial lines Its effects persist today According to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 3 out of every 4 neighborhoods in the USA that were redlined in the 1930s are still lowtomoderate income today and 2 out of every 3 are predominantly populated by people of color Click here to for more information about redlining A map of recent shootings lines up with the heavily redlined areas of the Bronx Harlem and northern and eastern Brooklyn showing clearly how todays violence is closely related to the ways that racist policies are embedded in our society Decades of government and societal disinvestment from practices like redlining means limited opportunity and resources and results in higher rates of poverty in some neighborhoods Disinvestment is when either government agencies or private companies deliberately withhold or withdraw resources and opportunity from a neighborhood or community The history of disinvesment is tied to racist practices and policies like denyng people of color loans to buy homes Disinvestment is also planned shrinkage a steady decline of public funding for public housing services education especially in cities and especially in neighborhoods populated mostly by people of color As a result of this disinvestment we see a clear relationship between poverty and violence As a neighborhoods poverty level increases so

public health we say that disinvestment produces environmental factors that make certain health outcomes more likely Environmental factors Health outcomes Due to a history of disinvestment New York City neighborhoods experience very different environmental factors that predict violence and other health outcomes By environmental we mean the entire physical social and economic context around us the built environment like housing and parks and access to schools jobs opportunity healthcare and more Whether or not a neighborhood experiences more violence can be explained by looking at whether its environment has protective factors which help prevent violence before it starts or risk factors which make violence a more likely outcome Protective factors include nbspChild health nbspEconomic
